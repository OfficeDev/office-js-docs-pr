# Open API specifications

Thank you for your interest in learning more about the new APIs and features that we are designing. We will make early versions of the API specifications available here for community feedback. Your input will go a long way toward ensuring that the final design meets the use cases that are important to you. 

The features described here might be in different stages of development, such as early design or public preview. When the feature is generally available, the content will be removed from this page and we will update our documentation to include the details of the new feature. 

_**Important:** The features listed here are still in the design and review phase and are not yet generally available. These features and APIs are subject to change._

## Visio JavaScript APIs
Visio Online is the new way to view and share Visio diagrams on the web. You can use the Visio JavaScript API 1.1 to extend the capabilities of Visio Online. Use these APIs against Visio diagrams embedded in a SharePoint page. Note that the Visio JavaScript API does not currently apply to [Office Add-ins](https://dev.office.com/docs/add-ins/overview/office-add-ins).

**See the [Visio JavaScript API 1.1](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js-docs/tree/VisioJs_1.1_Openspec) page to learn more and provide your feedback.**

## New Excel JavaScript APIs
Join us in reviewing our design for new Excel JavaScript APIs. New and updated APIs include customXML parts, conditional formatting, etc.

## New Word JavaScript APIs (1.3)
The Word JavaScript API 1.3 update contains the largest set of changes we've implemented since this API was introduced. With the new API, you’ll be able to: 

* Create and access list objects
* Create and access table objects
* Have more options for accessing and comparing range objects
* Document properties

These changes have been implemented across nearly all Word JavaScript API objects. This functionality is now or will soon be available in preview for Word 2016 on the desktop for both Windows and Mac, and on the iPad. Update your clients to the latest monthly build and start implementing these great features!
