# Get started developing Excel custom functions

With custom functions, developers can now add new functions to Excel by defining them in JavaScript or Typescript as part of an add-in. Excel users can access custom functions just as they would any native function in Excel, such as `SUM()`.

## Prerequisites

[!include[Excel custom functions note](../includes/excel-custom-functions-note.md)]

You'll need the following tools and related resources to begin creating custom functions.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 8.0.0 or later)

- [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (or another Git client)

- The latest version of [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) and the [Yeoman generator for Office Add-ins](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-office). To install these tools globally, run the following command via the command prompt:

    ```command&nbsp;line
    npm install -g yo generator-office
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Even if you've previously installed the Yeoman generator, we recommend you update your package to the latest version from npm.

## Build your first custom functions project

To start, you'll use the Yeoman generator to create the custom functions project. This will set up your project with the correct folder structure, source files, and dependencies to begin coding your custom functions.

1. Run the following command and then answer the prompts as follows.

    ```command&nbsp;line
    yo office
    ```

    - Choose a project type: `Excel Custom Functions Add-in project (...)`

    - Choose a script type: `JavaScript`

    - What do you want to name your add-in? `stock-ticker`

    The Yeoman generator will create the project files and install supporting Node components.

2. Navigate to the project folder you just created.

    ```command&nbsp;line
    cd stock-ticker
    ```

3. Trust the self-signed certificate you need to run this project. For detailed instructions for either Windows or Mac, see [Adding Self Signed Certificates as Trusted Root Certificate](https://github.com/OfficeDev/generator-office/blob/master/src/docs/ssl.md).  

4. Build the project.

    ```command&nbsp;line
    npm run build
    ```

5. Start the local web server, which runs in Node.js.

    - If you use Excel for Windows to test your custom functions, run the following command to start the local web server, launch Excel, and sideload the add-in:

        ```command&nbsp;line
         npm run start
        ```
        After running this command, your command prompt will show details about starting the web server. Excel will start with your add-in loaded. If you add-in does not load, check that you have completed step 3 properly.

    - If you use Excel Online to test your custom functions, run the following command to start the local web server:

        ```command&nbsp;line
        npm run start-web
        ```

         After running this command, your command prompt will show details about starting the web server. To use your functions, open a new workbook in Excel Online. In this workbook, you'll need to load your add-in. 

        To do this, select the **Insert** tab on the ribbon and select **Get Add-ins**. In the resulting new window, ensure you are on the **My Add-ins** tab. Next, select **Manage My Add-ins > Upload My Add-in**. Browse for your manifest file and upload it. If your add-in does not load, check you've completed step 3 correctly.

## Try out the prebuilt custom functions

The custom functions project that you created by using the Yeoman generator contains some prebuilt custom functions, defined within the **src/customfunctions.js** file. The **manifest.xml** file in the root directory of the project specifies that all custom functions belong to the `CONTOSO` namespace.

In your Excel workbook, try out the `ADD` custom function by completing the following steps:

1. Select a cell and type `=CONTOSO`. Notice that the autocomplete menu shows the list of all functions in the `CONTOSO` namespace.

2. Run the `CONTOSO.ADD` function, using numbers `10` and `200` as input parameters, by typing the value `=CONTOSO.ADD(10,200)` in the cell and pressing enter.

The `ADD` custom function computes the sum of the two numbers that you specify as input parameters. Typing `=CONTOSO.ADD(10,200)` should produce the result **210** in the cell after you press enter.

## Next steps

Congratulations, you've successfully created a custom function in an Excel add-in! Next, build a more complex add-in with streaming data capability. The following link takes you through the next steps in the Excel add-in with custom functions tutorial.
