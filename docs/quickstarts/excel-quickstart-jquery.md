# Build an Excel task pane add-in

In this article, you'll walk through the process of building an Excel task pane add-in. You'll use either the Office Add-ins Development Kit or the Yeoman generator to create your Office Add-in. Select the tab for the one you'd like to use and then follow the instructions to create your add-in and test it locally. If you'd like to create the add-in project within Visual Studio Code, we recommend the Office Add-ins Development Kit.

# [Office Add-ins Development Kit](#tab/devkit)

[!include[Dev_kit prerequisites](../includes/dev-kit-prerequisites.md)]

## Create the add-in project

Click the following button to create an add-in project using the Office Add-ins Development Kit for Visual Studio Code. You'll be prompted to install the extension if don't already have it. A page that contains the project description will open in Visual Studio Code.

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Create an add-in in Visual Studio Code](vscode://msoffice.microsoft-office-add-in-debugger/open-specific-sample?sample-id=excel-get-started-with-dev-kit)

In the prompted page, select **Create** to create the add-in project. In the **Workspace folder** dialog that opens, select the folder where you want to create the project.

The Office Add-ins Development Kit will create the project. It will then open the project in a *second* Visual Studio Code window. Close the original Visual Studio Code window.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use VSCode Insiders, or you have problems opening the project page in VSCode, install the extension manually by following [these steps](../develop/development-kit-overview.md?tabs=vscode), and find the sample in the sample gallery.
