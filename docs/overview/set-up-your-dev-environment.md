# Set up your development environment

This guide helps you set up tools so you can create Office Add-ins by following our quick starts or tutorials. You'll need to install the tools from the list below. If you already have these installed, you are ready to begin a quick start, such as this [Excel React quick start](../quickstarts/excel-quickstart-react.md).

- Node.js
- npm
- A Microsoft 365 account which includes the subscription version of Office
- A code editor of your choice
- The Office JavaScript linter

This guide assumes that you know how to use a command line tool.

## Install Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime you will need to develop modern Office Add-ins.

Install Node.js by [downloading the latest recommended version from their website](https://nodejs.org). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

## Install npm

npm is an open source software registry from which to download the packages used in developing Office Add-ins.

To install npm, run the following in the command line.

```command&nbsp;line
    npm install npm -g
```

To check if you already have npm installed and see the installed version, run the following in the command line.

```command&nbsp;line
npm -v
```

You may wish to use a Node version manager to allow you to switch between multiple versions of Node.js and npm, but this is not strictly necessary. For details on how to do this, [see npm's instructions](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

## Get Microsoft 365

If you don't already have a Microsoft 365 account, you can get a free, 90-day renewable Microsoft 365 subscription that includes all Office apps by joining the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/office/dev-program).

## Install a code editor

You can use any code editor or IDE that supports client-side development to build your web part, such as:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io)
- [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm)

## Install and use the Office JavaScript linter

Microsoft provides a JavaScript linter to help you catch common errors when using the Office JavaScript library. To install the linter, run the following two commands (after you've [installed Node.js](#install-nodejs) and [npm](#install-npm)).

```command&nbsp;line
npm install office-addin-lint --save-dev
npm install eslint-plugin-office-addins --save-dev
```

If you create an Office Add-in project with the Yo Office tool, then the rest of the setup is done for you. Run the linter with the following command either in the terminal of an editor, such as Visual Studio Code, or in a command prompt. Problems found by the linter appear in the terminal or prompt, and also appear directly in the code when you're using an editor that supports linter messages, such as Visual Studio Code. (For information about installing the Yo Office tool, go through one of our Office Add-in quick starts, such as [this one for Excel add-ins](../quickstarts/excel-quickstart-jquery.md).)

```command&nbsp;line
npm run lint
```

If your add-in project was created another way, take the following steps.

1. In the root of the project, create a text file named **.eslintrc.json**, if there isn't one already there. Be sure it has properties named `plugins` and `extends`, both of type array. The `plugins` array should include `"office-addins"` and the `extends` array should include `"plugin:office-addins/recommended"`. The following is a simple example. Your **.eslintrc.json** file may have additional properties and additional members of the two arrays.

   ```json
   {
     "plugins": [
       "office-addins"
     ],
     "extends": [
       "plugin:office-addins/recommended"
     ]
   }
   ```

1. In the root of the project, open the **package.json** file and be sure that the `scripts` array has the following member.

   ```json
   "lint": "office-addin-lint check",
   ```

1. Run the linter with the following command either in the terminal of an editor, such as Visual Studio Code, or in a command prompt. Problems found by the linter appear in the terminal or prompt, and also appear directly in the code when you're using an editor that supports linter messages, such as Visual Studio Code.

   ```command&nbsp;line
   npm run lint
   ```

## Next steps

Try creating your own add-in or use Script Lab to try built-in samples.

### Create an Office Add-in

You can quickly create a basic add-in for Excel, OneNote, Outlook, PowerPoint, Project, or Word by completing a [5-minute quick start](../index.yml). If you've previously completed a quick start and want to create a slightly more complex add-in, you should try the [tutorial](../index.yml).

### Explore the APIs with Script Lab

Explore the library of built-in samples in [Script Lab](explore-with-script-lab.md) to get a sense for the capabilities of the Office JavaScript APIs.
