# Set up your development environment

This guide helps you set up tools so you can create Office Add-ins by following our quick starts or tutorials. You'll need to install the tools from the list below. If you already have these installed, you are ready to begin a quick start, such as this [Excel React quick start](../quickstarts/excel-quickstart-react.md).

- Node.js
- npm
- A Microsoft 365 account which includes the subscription version of Office
- A code editor of your choice

This guide assumes that you know how to use a command line tool. 

## Install Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime you will need to develop modern Office Add-ins.

Install Node.js by [downloading the latest recommended version from their website](https://nodejs.org). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

## Install npm

npm is an open source software registry from which to download the packages used in developing Office Add-ins.

To install npm, run the following in the command line:

```command&nbsp;line
    npm install npm -g
```

To check if you already have npm installed and see the installed version, run the following in the command line:

```command&nbsp;line
npm -v
```

You may wish to use a Node version manager to allow you to switch between multiple versions of Node.js and npm, but this is not strictly necessary. For details on how to do this, [see npm's instructions](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

## Get Microsoft 365

If you don't already have a Microsoft 365 account, you can get a free, 90-day renewable Microsoft 365 subscription that includes all Office apps by joining the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/office/dev-program).

## Install a code editor

You can use any code editor or IDE that supports client-side development to build your web part, such as:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io)
- [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm)

## Next steps

Try creating your own add-in or use Script Lab to try built-in samples.

### Create an Office Add-in

You can quickly create a basic add-in for Excel, OneNote, Outlook, PowerPoint, Project, or Word by completing a [5-minute quick start](../index.yml). If you've previously completed a quick start and want to create a slightly more complex add-in, you should try the [tutorial](../index.yml).

### Explore the APIs with Script Lab

Explore the library of built-in samples in [Script Lab](explore-with-script-lab.md) to get a sense for the capabilities of the Office JavaScript APIs.
