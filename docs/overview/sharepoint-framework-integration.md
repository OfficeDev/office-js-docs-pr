# Building Office Add-ins using the SharePoint Framework (SPFx) (preview)

Developers will soon be able to build Office Add-ins using the SharePoint Framework. Adding Office Add-ins to an already rich integration between Microsoft Teams tabs and the SharePoint Framework will delight developers and users alike.

## Why use the SharePoint Framework?

The SharePoint Framework (SPFx) provides you with full support for client-side SharePoint development, integration with SharePoint data, and support for open source tooling. Using SPFx provides several benefits for an add-in developer, that include:

- SharePoint hosting for system integrators developing Office Add-ins
- Existing skills reuse for those with SharePoint expertise
- Ability to use and maintain the same add-in on a Teams site/bot and SharePoint site by developing it as an SPFx web part
- Integrated authentication and authorization with Single Sign-On (SSO)

## Supported Office hosts and platforms

Initially, SharePoint Framework integration will be available in the following hosts and platforms.

- Outlook on the web (modern) with Exchange Online, connected to an Office 365 subscription
