# Beginner's guide

Want to get started building your own cross-platform Office extensions? The following steps show you what to read first, what tools to install, and recommended tutorials to complete.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're experienced in creating VSTO add-ins for Office, we recommend that you immediately turn to [VSTO add-in developer's guide](learning-path-transition.md), which is a superset of the information in this article.

## Step 0: Prerequisites

- Office Add-ins are essentially web applications embedded in Office. So, you should first have a basic understanding of web applications and how they are hosted on the web. There's an enormous amount of information about this on the Internet, in books, and in online courses. A good way to start if you have no prior knowledge of web applications at all is to search for "What is a web app?" on Bing.
- The primary programming language you'll use in creating Office Add-ins is JavaScript or TypeScript. You can think of TypeScript as a strongly-typed version of JavaScript. If you are not familiar with either of these languages, but you have experience with VBA, VB.Net, C#, you'll probably find TypeScript easier to learn. Again, there's a wealth of information about these languages on the Internet, in books, and in online courses.

## Step 1: Begin with fundamentals

We know you're eager to start coding, but there are some things about Office Add-ins that you should read before you open your IDE or code editor.

- [Office Add-ins platform overview](office-add-ins.md): Find out what Office Web Add-ins are and how they differ from older ways of extending Office, such as VSTO add-ins.
- [Develop Office Add-ins](../develop/develop-overview.md): Get an overview of Office Add-in development and lifecycle including tooling, creating an add-in UI, and using the JavaScript APIs to interact with the Office document.
- ["Hello world" samples](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-samples/tree/main/Samples/hello-world): Learn how to build the simplest Office Add-in with only a manifest, HTML web page, and a logo. These samples will help you understand the fundamental parts of an Office Add-in.

There are a lot of links in those articles, but if you're a beginner with Office Add-ins, we recommend that you come back here when you've read them and continue with the next section.

## Step 2: Explore and try out existing samples

You've got the big picture now, so dive in by installing our [Script Lab add-in](explore-with-script-lab.md) to try out code samples in the various Office applications. The samples available in Script Lab show how to use many of the Office JavaScript APIs.

## Step 3: Install tools and create your first add-in

Next, create an add-in using one of our quick starts. For the purpose of learning the platform, we recommend the [Excel quick start](../quickstarts/excel-quickstart-jquery.md).

## Step 4: Code

You can't learn to drive by reading the owner's manual, so start coding with this [Excel tutorial](../tutorials/excel-tutorial.md). You'll be using the Office JavaScript library and some JSON or XML in the add-in's manifest. There's no need to memorize anything, because you'll be getting more background about both in a later steps.

## Step 5: Understand the JavaScript library

For an overview of the Office JavaScript library, see this tutorial from Microsoft Learn training: [Understand the Office JavaScript APIs](/training/modules/understand-office-javascript-apis/index).

Then return to Script Lab and use it like a playground: make your own code changes to the local copy of any samples you try and see how the results are affected.

## Step 6: Understand the manifest

Get an understanding of the purposes of the add-in manifest and an introduction to its XML markup or JSON in [Office Add-ins manifest](../develop/add-in-manifests.md).
