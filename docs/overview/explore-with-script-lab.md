# Explore Office JavaScript API using Script Lab

The [Script Lab add-in](https://store.office.com/app.aspx?assetid=WA104380862), which is available free from the Office store, enables you to explore the Office JavaScript API right there in Office. Script Lab is a great tool to add to your development toolkit as you prototype and verify functionality you want in your add-in.

## What is Script Lab?

Script Lab is a tool for anyone who wants to learn about developing Office Add-ins using Office Javascript API in Excel, Word, and PowerPoint. It provides IntelliSense so you can see what's available and is built on the Monaco framework, the same framework as Visual Studio Code. Through Script Lab you can access a library of samples to quickly try out features or use a sample as the base for your own. You are also welcome to expand the sample library by adding snippets to the [office-js-snippets repo](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js-snippets#office-js-snippets). Another cool thing is you can try beta or preview functionality like [custom functions](/office/dev/add-ins/excel/custom-functions-overview).

> [!TIP]
> In order to participate in beta or preview, you may have to sign up for the [Office Insider program](https://products.office.com/office-insider).
