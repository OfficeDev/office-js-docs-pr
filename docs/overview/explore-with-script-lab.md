# Explore Office JavaScript API using Script Lab

The [Script Lab add-in](https://store.office.com/app.aspx?assetid=WA104380862), which is available free from the Office store, enables you to explore the Office JavaScript API while you are working in an Office program such as Excel or Word. Script Lab is a convenient tool to add to your development toolkit as you prototype and verify functionality you want in your add-in.

## What is Script Lab?

Script Lab is a tool for anyone who wants to learn how to develop Office Add-ins using the Office JavaScript API in Excel, Word, or PowerPoint. It provides IntelliSense so you can see what's available and is built on the Monaco framework, the same framework used by Visual Studio Code. Through Script Lab, you can access a library of samples to quickly try out features or you can choose a sample as the base for your own code. You are also welcome to expand the sample library by adding snippets to the [office-js-snippets repo](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js-snippets#office-js-snippets). Another exciting feature of Script Lab is beta or preview functionality like [custom functions](/office/dev/add-ins/excel/custom-functions-overview) is available for you to try.

> [!TIP]
> To participate in beta or preview, you may have to sign up for the [Office Insider program](https://products.office.com/office-insider).
