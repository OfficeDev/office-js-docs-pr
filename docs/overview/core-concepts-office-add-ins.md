# Office Add-in development lifecycle

All Office Add-ins are built upon the Office Add-ins platform. They share a common framework through which add-in capabilities are implemented. This means that regardless of whether you're creating an add-in for Excel, Outlook, or another Office application, you can have features such as dialog boxes, add-in commands, task panes, and single sign-on (SSO).

For any add-in you build, you need to understand the following concepts.

- Office application and platform availability
- Office JavaScript API programming patterns
- How to specify an add-in's settings and capabilities in the manifest file
- Troubleshooting your add-in
- Publishing your add-in

For the best foundation for these common features and application-specific implementations, review the following documentation.
