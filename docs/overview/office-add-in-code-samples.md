# Office Add-in code samples

These code samples are written to help you learn how to use various features when developing Office Add-ins.

## Getting started

The following samples show how to build the simplest Office Add-in with only a manifest, HTML web page, and a logo. These components are the fundamental parts of an Office Add-in. For additional getting started information, see our [quick starts](../quickstarts/excel-quickstart-jquery.md) and [tutorials](/search/?terms=tutorial&scope=Office%20Add-ins).
