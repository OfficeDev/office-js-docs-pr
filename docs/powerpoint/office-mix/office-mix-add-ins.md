# Office Mix add-ins




Microsoft Office Mix is a platform for creating Office Add-ins that you embed in PowerPoint to enable audio-visual components to your PowerPoint presentations. LabsJS, on the other hand, is a technology that allows you to create specialized Office Mix instances, called labs, that you can then insert into your Office Mix. These labs extend Office Mix functionality so that you can create fully interactive educational components like simulations, demonstrations, and quizzes.

## Let's start with Office Mix

Let's start by talking about the end point - Office Mix. Office Mix is a Microsoft technology that allows users to embed instructional components like videos, voice, music, ink, and on-slide actions in Microsoft PowerPoint presentations and then publish them online. Users can use these dynamic instructional presentations, called Mixes, to turn their PowerPoint presentations into dynamic lessons.

To see examples of Mixes in action, browse the many stunning Office Mix lesson demos in the [Office Mix Gallery](https://mix.office.com/Gallery). Notice the effective use of Mixes in each of these lessons.


## How does LabsJS fit in with Office Mix?

LabsJS extends the concept of Office Mix. Whereas an Office Mix turns a PowerPoint presentation into a dynamic lesson, with LabsJS, you can enable users to interact with the lesson in enhanced ways. The interactivity comes in the form of demonstrations, quizzes, simulations, and many other interactive content types. These new, interactive educational components are called labs. Under the covers, these labs are simply Office Mix Add-ins created using HTML5 and JavaScript.

These labs are in fact add-ins that are written in JavaScript using the labs.js API ([LabsJS JavaScript API reference](../../../reference/office-mix/labsjs-javascript-api-reference.md)). Labs.js serves as an abstraction layer on top of the office.js library. In a nutshell, labs.js enables creating these labs and inserting them into Office Mix instances; the Mixes, then, are rendered in PowerPoint.


## Take a look

You've already been introduced to the [Office Mix Gallery](https://mix.office.com/Gallery), but pay particular attention to three of the Office Mix examples that contain and run LabsJS labs. You should review these examples to get a sense of the potential of labs. Note where PowerPoint ends and Office Mix technology begins, and then where LabsJS functionality starts up and allows you to interact with the Mix, in the following:
