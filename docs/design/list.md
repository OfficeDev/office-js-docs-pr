# List component in Office UI Fabric

Lists provide a consistent layout when interacting with large collections of content, even when the content is text-heavy. Lists allow users to easily scan through content. 
  
#### Example: List in a task pane

## Best practices

- End each entry in a list with a period if:
  - All entries are complete sentences.
  - One or more of the entries contains both a fragment and a complete sentence that offers additional information.
  - The entries all complete the introductory sentence or fragment.
- Separate consecutive lists on a page with headings.

## Variants

|**Variation**|**Description**|**Example**|
|:------------|:--------------|:----------|
|**Grid list**|Use when detailed information is needed with each list item.|![Grid List image](../images/list.png)<br/>|
|**Variable height item list**|Use when large imagery and text is needed.|![Variable height item List image](../images/list-grid.png)<br/>|
