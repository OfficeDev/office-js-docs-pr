# First-run experience

A first-run experience is the experience a user has when they open your add-in for the first time. This experience shapes the user's impression of your add-in and can strongly influence their likelihood to continue use. Follow these best practices when crafting your first-run experience.


## Best practices

|Do|Don't|
|:------|:------|
|Provide a simple and brief introduction to the main actions in  the add-in. | Don't include information and call-outs that are not relevant to getting started.
|Give users the opportunity to complete an action that will positively impact their use of the add-in.| Don't expect users to learn everything at once. Focus on the action that provides the most value.
|Create an engaging experience that users will want to complete. | Don't force the users to click through the first-run experience. Give users an option to bypass the first-run experience. |


Consider whether showing users the first-run experience once or many times is important to your scenario. For example, if users use your add-in periodically, they might forget how to use it, and it might be helpful to see the first-run experience more than once.

Apply the following patterns as applicable to create or enhance the first-run experience for your add-in.

## Carousel

The carousel takes users through a series of features or information pages before they start using the add-in.

## Value Placemat

The value placement communicates your add-in's value proposition through logo placement, a clear value proposition, feature summary, and a call-to-action.
