# UX Design Patterns for Office Add-ins

Designing the user experience for Office Add-ins should not only provide a compelling experience for Office users but also extend the overall Office experience by fitting seamlessly within the default Office UI.  

Providing a clean, modern user experience that incorporates and balances design elements from both Microsoft's Fabric UI design language as well as the partner's unique brand and visual identity will help increase user retention and adoption of your add-in.

The provided patterns are best practice solutions based on common customer scenarios and user experience research and are meant to provide both a quick entry point to designing and developing add-ins as well as guidance to achieve balance between Microsoft and brand elements.

Use the UX pattern templates to:

* Apply solutions to common customer scenarios.
* Apply design best practices.
* Incorporate [Office UI Fabric](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric#/get-started) components and styles.
* Build add-ins that visually integrate with the default Office UI.
* Use templates as a scaffold for partner designs.
* Use templates and design tools to ideate and visualize UX.
