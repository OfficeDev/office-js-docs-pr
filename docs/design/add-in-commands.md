# Add-in commands for Excel, PowerPoint, and Word

Add-in commands are UI elements that extend the Office UI and start actions in your add-in. You can use add-in commands to add a button on the ribbon or an item to a context menu. When users select an add-in command, they initiate actions such as running JavaScript code, or showing a page of the add-in in a task pane. Add-in commands help users find and use your add-in, which can help increase your add-in's adoption and reuse, and improve customer retention.

For an overview of the feature, see the video [Add-in Commands in the Office app ribbon](https://channel9.msdn.com/events/Build/2016/P551).

> [!NOTE]
> SharePoint catalogs do not support add-in commands. You can deploy add-in commands via [Centralized Deployment](../publish/centralized-deployment.md) or [AppSource](/office/dev/store/submit-to-appsource-via-partner-center), or use [sideloading](../testing/create-a-network-shared-folder-catalog-for-task-pane-and-content-add-ins.md) to deploy your add-in command for testing.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Add-in commands are also supported in Outlook. For more information, see [Add-in commands for Outlook](../outlook/add-in-commands-for-outlook.md).

## Command capabilities

The following command capabilities are currently supported.

> [!NOTE]
> Content add-ins do not currently support add-in commands.

### Extension points

- Ribbon tabs - Extend built-in tabs or create a new custom tab.
- Context menus - Extend selected context menus.

### Control types

- Simple buttons - trigger specific actions.
- Menus - simple menu dropdown with buttons that trigger actions.

### Actions

- ShowTaskpane - Displays one or multiple panes that load custom HTML pages inside them.
- ExecuteFunction - Loads an invisible HTML page and then execute a JavaScript function within it. To show UI within your function (such as errors, progress, or additional input) you can use the [displayDialog](/javascript/api/office/office.ui) API.  

### Default Enabled or Disabled Status

You can specify whether the command is enabled or disabled when your add-in launches, and programmatically change the setting.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is not supported in all Office applications or scenarios. For more information, see [Enable and Disable Add-in Commands](disable-add-in-commands.md).

### Position on the ribbon (preview)

You can specify where a custom tab appears on the Office application's ribbon, such as "just to the right of the Home tab".

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is not supported in all Office applications or scenarios. For more information, see [Position a custom tab on the ribbon](custom-tab-placement.md).

### Integration of built-in Office buttons (preview)

You can insert the built-in Office ribbon buttons into your custom command groups and custom ribbon tabs.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is not supported in all Office applications or scenarios. For more information, see [Integrate built-in Office buttons into custom tabs](built-in-button-integration.md).

### Contextual tabs (preview)

You can specify that a tab is only visible on the ribbon in certain contexts, such as when a chart is selected in Excel.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is not supported in all Office applications or scenarios. For more information, see [Create custom contextual tabs in Office Add-ins](contextual-tabs.md).

## Supported platforms

Add-in commands are currently supported on the following platforms, except for limitations specified in the subsections of [Command capabilities](#command-capabilities) earlier.

- Office on Windows (build 16.0.6769+, connected to a Microsoft 365 subscription)
- Office 2019 on Windows
- Office on Mac (build 15.33+, connected to a Microsoft 365 subscription)
- Office 2019 on Mac
- Office on the web

> [!NOTE]
> For information about support in Outlook, see [Add-in commands for Outlook](../outlook/add-in-commands-for-outlook.md).

## Debugging

To debug an Add-in Command, you must run it in Office on the web. For details, see [Debug add-ins in Office on the web](../testing/debug-add-ins-in-office-online.md).

## Best practices

Apply the following best practices when you develop add-in commands:

- Use commands to represent a specific action with a clear and specific outcome for users. Do not combine multiple actions in a single button.
- Provide granular actions that make common tasks within your add-in more efficient to perform. Minimize the number of steps an action takes to complete.
- For the placement of your commands in the Office app ribbon:
  - Place commands on an existing tab (Insert, Review, and so on) if the functionality provided fits there. For example, if your add-in enables users to insert media, add a group to the Insert tab. Note that not all tabs are available across all Office versions. For more information, see [Office Add-ins XML manifest](../develop/add-in-manifests.md).
  - Place commands on the Home tab if the functionality doesn't fit on another tab, and you have fewer than six top-level commands. You can also add commands to the Home tab if your add-in needs to work across Office versions (such as Office on the web or desktop) and a tab is not available in all versions (for example, the Design tab doesn't exist in Office on the web).  
  - Place commands on a custom tab if you have more than six top-level commands.
  - Name your group to match the name of your add-in. If you have multiple groups, name each group based on the functionality that the commands in that group provide.
  - Do not add superfluous buttons to increase the real estate of your add-in.
  - Do not position a custom tab to the left of the Home tab, or give it focus by default when the document opens, unless your add-in is the primary way users will interact with the document. Giving excessive prominence to your add-in inconveniences and annoys users and administrators.
  - If your add-in is the primary way users interact with the document and you have a custom ribbon tab, consider integrating into the tab the buttons for the Office functions that users will frequently need.
  - If the functionality that is provided with a custom tab should only be available in certain contexts, use [custom contextual tabs](contextual-tabs.md). If you use custom contextual tabs, make sure to implement a [fallback experience for when your add-in runs on platforms that don't support custom contextual tabs](contextual-tabs.md#implement-an-alternate-ui-experience-when-custom-contextual-tabs-are-not-supported).

  > [!NOTE]
  > Add-ins that take up too much space might not pass [AppSource validation](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies).

- For all icons, follow the [icon design guidelines](add-in-icons.md).
- Provide a version of your add-in that also works on Office applications that do not support commands. A single add-in manifest can work in both command-aware (with commands) and non-command-aware (as a task pane) applications.

## Next steps

The best way to get started using add-in commands is to take a look at the [Office Add-in commands samples](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-Commands-Samples/) on GitHub.

For more information about specifying add-in commands in your manifest, see [Create add-in commands in your manifest](../develop/create-addin-commands.md) and the [VersionOverrides](../reference/manifest/versionoverrides.md) reference content.
