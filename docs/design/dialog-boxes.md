# Dialog boxes in Office Add-ins
 
Dialog boxes are surfaces that float above the active Office application window. You can use dialog boxes to provide additional screen space for tasks such as sign-in pages that can't be opened directly in a task pane or requests to confirm an action taken by a user, or to show videos that might be too small if confined to a task pane.

## Best practices

|**Do**|**Don't**|

||<ul><li>Don't open a dialog box unless the scenario requires it.</li></ul>|
