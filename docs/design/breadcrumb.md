# Breadcrumb component in Office UI Fabric

In Office Add-ins, use breadcrumbs for navigation. They show the current page’s location in a hierarchy, and help users understand where they are in relation to the rest of the hierarchy. Additionally, breadcrumbs provide one-click navigation to higher levels in the hierarchy.
  
#### Example: Breadcrumb in a task pane

## Best practices

|**Do**|**Don't**|
|:------------|:--------------|
|Place breadcrumbs at the top of a layout in an add-in, above a list of items, or above the main content of a layout.<br/><br/>![Do Breadcrumb image](../images/breadcrumb-do.png) |Don’t use breadcrumbs as the primary way to navigate to other pages.<br/><br/>![Don't Breadcrumb image](../images/breadcrumb-dont.png)|
