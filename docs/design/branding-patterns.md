## Best practices

<br/>

|Do |Don't|
|:---- |:----|
| Use familiar UI components with applied branding accents like typography and color. | Don't invent new UI components that contradict established Office UI. | 
| Place your add-in branding in a brand bar footer at the bottom of your UI. | Don't repeat your task pane name in an immediately adjacent brand bar at the top of your UI. |
| Use brand elements sparingly. Fit your solution into Office such that is complementary. | Don't insert excessively branded elements into Office UI that distract and confuse customers. |
| Make your solution recognizable and connect your screens together with consistent visual elements. | Don't hide your solution with unrecognizable and inconsistently applied visual elements. |
| Build connection with a parent service or business to ensure that customers know and trust your solution. | Don't make customers learn a new brand concept if there is a useful and understandable relationship that can be leveraged to build trust and value. |

## Brand Bar

The brand bar is a space in the footer to include your brand name and logo. It also serves as a link to your brand's website and an optional access location.
