# Add Custom keyboard shortcuts to your Office Add-ins (preview)

Keyboard shortcuts, also known as key combinations, enable your add-in's users to work more efficiently and they improve the add-in's accessibility for users with disabilities by providing an alternative to the mouse.

[!include[Keyboard shortcut prerequisites](../includes/keyboard-shortcuts-prerequisites.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> To start with a working version of an add-in with keyboard shortcuts already enabled, clone and run the sample [Excel Keyboard Shortcuts](https://github.com/OfficeDev/PnP-OfficeAddins/tree/master/Samples/excel-keyboard-shortcuts). When you are ready to add keyboard shortcuts to your own add-in, continue with this article.

There are three steps to add keyboard shortcuts to an add-in:

1. [Configure the add-in's manifest](#configure-the-manifest).
1. [Create or edit the shortcuts JSON file](#create-or-edit-the-shortcuts-json-file) to define actions and their keyboard shortcuts.
1. [Add one or more runtime calls](#create-a-mapping-of-actions-to-their-functions) of the [Office.actions.associate](/javascript/api/office/office.actions#associate) API to map a function to each action.

## Configure the manifest

There are two small changes to the manifest to make. One is to enable the add-in to use a shared runtime and the other is to point to a JSON-formatted file where you defined the keyboard shortcuts.

### Configure the add-in to use a shared runtime

Adding custom keyboard shortcuts requires your add-in to use the shared runtime. For more information, [Configure an add-in to use a shared runtime](../develop/configure-your-add-in-to-use-a-shared-runtime.md).

### Link the mapping file to the manifest

Immediately *below* (not inside) the `<VersionOverrides>` element in the manifest, add an [ExtendedOverrides](../reference/manifest/extendedoverrides.md) element. Set the `Url` attribute to the full URL of a JSON file in your project that you will create in a later step.

```xml
    ...
    </VersionOverrides>  
    <ExtendedOverrides Url="https://contoso.com/addin/shortcuts.json"></ExtendedOverrides>
</OfficeApp>
```

## Create or edit the shortcuts JSON file

Create a JSON file in your project. Be sure the path of the file matches the location you specified for the `Url` attribute of the [ExtendedOverrides](../reference/manifest/extendedoverrides.md) element. This file will describe your keyboard shortcuts, and the actions that they will invoke.

1. Inside the JSON file, there are two arrays. The actions array will contain objects that define the actions to be invoked and the shortcuts array will contain objects that map key combinations onto actions. Here is an example:

    ```json
    {
        "actions": [
            {
                "id": "SHOWTASKPANE",
                "type": "ExecuteFunction",
                "name": "Show task pane for add-in"
            },
            {
                "id": "HIDETASKPANE",
                "type": "ExecuteFunction",
                "name": "Hide task pane for add-in"
            }
        ],
        "shortcuts": [
            {
                "action": "SHOWTASKPANE",
                "key": {
                    "default": "CTRL+SHIFT+UP"
                }
            },
            {
                "action": "HIDETASKPANE",
                "key": {
                    "default": "CTRL+SHIFT+DOWN"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    For more information about the JSON objects, see [Constructing the action objects](#constructing-the-action-objects) and [Constructing the shortcut objects](#constructing-the-shortcut-objects). The complete schema for the shortcuts JSON is at [extended-manifest.schema.json](https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/office-js/extended-manifest.schema.json).

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can use "CONTROL" in place of "CTRL" throughout this article.

    In a later step, the actions will themselves be mapped to functions that you write. In this example, you will later map SHOWTASKPANE to a function that calls the `Office.addin.showAsTaskpane` method and HIDETASKPANE to a function that calls the `Office.addin.hide` method.

## Create a mapping of actions to their functions

1. In your project, open the JavaScript file loaded by your HTML page in the `<FunctionFile>` element.
1. In the JavaScript file, use the [Office.actions.associate](/javascript/api/office/office.actions#associate) API to map each action that you specified in the JSON file to a JavaScript function. Add the following JavaScript to the file. Note the following about the code:

    - The first parameter is one of the actions from the JSON file.
    - The second parameter is the function that runs when a user presses the key combination that is mapped to the action in the JSON file.

    ```javascript
    Office.actions.associate('-- action ID goes here--', function () {

    });
    ```

1. To continue the example, use `'SHOWTASKPANE'` as the first parameter.
1. For the body of the function, use the [Office.addin.showTaskpane](/javascript/api/office/office.addin#showastaskpane--) method to open the add-in's task pane. When you are done, the code should look like the following:

    ```javascript
    Office.actions.associate('SHOWTASKPANE', function () {
        return Office.addin.showAsTaskpane()
            .then(function () {
                return;
            })
            .catch(function (error) {
                return error.code;
            });
    });
    ```

1. Add a second call of `Office.actions.associate` function to map the `HIDETASKPANE` action to a function that calls [Office.addin.hide](/javascript/api/office/office.addin#hide--). The following is an example:

    ```javascript
    Office.actions.associate('HIDETASKPANE', function () {
        return Office.addin.hide()
            .then(function () {
                return;
            })
            .catch(function (error) {
                return error.code;
            });
    });
    ```

Following the previous steps lets your add-in toggle the visibility of the task pane by pressing **Ctrl+Shift+Up arrow key** and **Ctrl+Shift+Down arrow key**. This is the same behavior as shown in the [sample excel keyboard shortcuts add-in](https://github.com/OfficeDev/PnP-OfficeAddins/tree/master/Samples/excel-keyboard-shortcuts).

## Details and restrictions

### Constructing the action objects

Use the following guidelines when specifying the objects in the `action` array of the shortcuts.json:

- The property names `id` and `name` are mandatory.
- The `id` property is used to uniquely identify the action to invoke using a keyboard shortcut.
- The `name` property must be a user friendly string describing the action. It must be a combination of the characters A - Z, a - z, 0 - 9, and the punctuation marks "-", "_", and "+".
- The `type` property is optional. Currently only `ExecuteFunction` type is supported.

The following is an example:

```json
    "actions": [
        {
            "id": "SHOWTASKPANE",
            "type": "ExecuteFunction",
            "name": "Show task pane for add-in"
        },
        {
            "id": "HIDETASKPANE",
            "type": "ExecuteFunction",
            "name": "Hide task pane for add-in"
        }
    ]
```

The complete schema for the shortcuts JSON is at [extended-manifest.schema.json](https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/office-js/extended-manifest.schema.json).

### Constructing the shortcut objects

Use the following guidelines when specifying the objects in the `shortcuts` array of the shortcuts.json:

- The property names `action`, `key`, and `default` are required.
- The value of the `action` property is a string and must match one of the `id` properties in the action object.
- The `default` property can be any combination of the characters A - Z, a -z, 0 - 9, and the punctuation marks "-", "_", and "+". (By convention, lower case letters are not used in these properties.)
- The `default` property must contain the name of at least one modifier key (ALT, CTRL, SHIFT) and only one other key.
- For Macs, we also support the COMMAND modifier key.
- For Macs, ALT is mapped to the OPTION key. For Windows, COMMAND is mapped to the CTRL key.
- When two characters are linked to the same physical key in a standard keyboard, then they are synonyms in the `default` property; for example, ALT+a and ALT+A are the same shortcut, so are CTRL+- and CTRL+\_ because "-" and "_" are the same physical key.
- The "+" character indicates that the keys on either side of it are pressed simultaneously.

The following is an example:

```json
    "shortcuts": [
        {
            "action": "SHOWTASKPANE",
            "key": {
                "default": "CTRL+SHIFT+UP"
            }
        },
        {
            "action": "HIDETASKPANE",
            "key": {
                "default": "CTRL+SHIFT+DOWN"
            }
        }
    ]
```

The complete schema for the shortcuts JSON is at [extended-manifest.schema.json](https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/office-js/extended-manifest.schema.json).

> [!NOTE]
> Keytips, also known as sequential key shortcuts, such as the Excel shortcut to choose a fill color **Alt+H, H**, are not supported in Office Add-ins.

### Using shortcuts when the focus is in the task pane

Currently, the keyboard shortcuts for an Office Add-in can only be invoked when the user's focus is in the worksheet. When the user's focus is inside the Office UI (such as the task pane), none of the add-in's shortcuts are ignored. As a workaround, the add-in can define keyboard handlers that can invoke certain actions when the user's focus is inside of the add-in UI.

## Using key combinations that are already used by Office or another add-in

During the preview period, there is no system for determining what happens when a user presses a key combination that is registered by an add-in and also by Office or by another add-in. Behavior is undefined.

Currently, there is no workaround when two or more add-ins have registered the same keyboard shortcut, but you can minimize conflicts with Excel with these good practices:

- Use only keyboard shortcuts with the following pattern in your add-in: **Ctrl+Shift+Alt+*x***, where *x* is some other key.
- If you need more keyboard shortcuts, check the [list of Excel keyboard shortcuts](https://support.microsoft.com/office/keyboard-shortcuts-in-excel-1798d9d5-842a-42b8-9c99-9b7213f0040f), and avoid using any of them in your add-in.

## Browser shortcuts that cannot be overridden

You cannot use any of the following keyboard combinations. They are used by browsers and cannot be overridden. This list is a work in progress. If you discover other combinations that cannot be overridden, please let us know by using the feedback tool at the bottom of this page.

- Ctrl+N
- Ctrl+Shift+N
- Ctrl+T
- Ctrl+Shift+T
- Ctrl+W
- Ctrl+PgUp/PgDn
