# Use Office UI Fabric React in Office Add-ins

Office UI Fabric is a JavaScript front-end framework for building user experiences for Office. If you build your add-in using React, consider using Fabric React to create your user experience. Fabric provides several React-based UX components, like buttons or checkboxes, that you can use in your add-in.

This article describes how to create an add-in that's built with React and uses Fabric React components.

> [!NOTE]
> [Fabric Core](office-ui-fabric.md#use-fabric-core-icons-fonts-colors) is included with Fabric React, which means your add-in will also have access to Fabric Core after you've completed the steps in this article.

## Create an add-in project

You'll use the Yeoman generator for Office Add-ins to create an add-in project that uses React.

### Install the prerequisites

[!include[Yeoman generator prerequisites](../includes/quickstart-yo-prerequisites.md)]

### Create the project

[!include[Yeoman generator create project guidance](../includes/yo-office-command-guidance.md)]

- **Choose a project type:** `Office Add-in Task Pane project using React framework`
- **Choose a script type:** `TypeScript`
- **What do you want to name your add-in?** `My Office Add-in`
- **Which Office client application would you like to support?** `Word`

After you complete the wizard, the generator creates the project and installs supporting Node components.

[!include[Yeoman generator next steps](../includes/yo-office-next-steps.md)]

### Try it out

1. Navigate to the root folder of the project.

    ```command&nbsp;line
    cd "My Office Add-in"
    ```

2. Complete the following steps to start the local web server and sideload your add-in.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Office Add-ins should use HTTPS, not HTTP, even when you are developing. If you are prompted to install a certificate after you run one of the following commands, accept the prompt to install the certificate that the Yeoman generator provides. You may also have to run your command prompt or terminal as an administrator for the changes to be made.

    > [!TIP]
    > If you're testing your add-in on Mac, run the following command before proceeding. When you run this command, the local web server starts.
    >
    > ```command&nbsp;line
    > npm run dev-server
    > ```

    - To test your add-in in Word, run the following command in the root directory of your project. This starts the local web server (if it's not already running) and opens Word with your add-in loaded.

        ```command&nbsp;line
        npm start
        ```

    - To test your add-in in Word on a browser, run the following command in the root directory of your project. When you run this command, the local web server will start (if it's not already running).

        ```command&nbsp;line
        npm run start:web
        ```

        To use your add-in, open a new document in Word on the web and then sideload your add-in by following the instructions in [Sideload Office Add-ins in Office on the web](../testing/sideload-office-add-ins-for-testing.md#sideload-an-office-add-in-in-office-on-the-web).

3. In Word, choose the **Home** tab, and then choose the **Show Taskpane** button in the ribbon to open the add-in task pane. Notice the default text and the **Run** button at the bottom of the task pane. In the remainder of this walkthrough, you'll redefine this text and button by creating a React component that uses UX components from Fabric React.

## Create a React component that uses Fabric React

At this point, you've created a very basic task pane add-in that's built using React. Next, complete the following steps to create a new React component (`ButtonPrimaryExample`) within the add-in project. The component uses the `Label` and `PrimaryButton` components from Fabric React.

1. Open the project folder created by the Yeoman generator, and go to **src\taskpane\components**.
2. In that folder, create a new file named **Button.tsx**.
3. In **Button.tsx**, add the following code to define the `ButtonPrimaryExample` component.

```typescript
import * as React from 'react';
import { PrimaryButton, IButtonProps } from 'office-ui-fabric-react/lib/Button';
import { Label } from 'office-ui-fabric-react/lib/Label';

export class ButtonPrimaryExample extends React.Component<IButtonProps, {}> {
  public constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  insertText = async () => {
    // In the click event, write text to the document.
    await Word.run(async (context) => {
      let body = context.document.body;
      body.insertParagraph('Hello Office UI Fabric React!', Word.InsertLocation.end);
      await context.sync();
    });
  }

  public render() {
    let { disabled } = this.props;
    return (
      <div className='ms-BasicButtonsExample'>
        <Label>Click the button to insert text.</Label>
        <PrimaryButton
          data-automation-id='test'
          disabled={ disabled }
          text='Insert text...'
          onClick={ this.insertText } />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

This code does the following:

- References the React library using `import * as React from 'react';`.
- References the Fabric components (`PrimaryButton`, `IButtonProps`, `Label`) that are used to create `ButtonPrimaryExample`.
- Declares the new `ButtonPrimaryExample` component using `export class ButtonPrimaryExample extends React.Component`.
- Declares the `insertText` function that will handle the button's `onClick` event.
- Defines the UI of the React component in the `render` function. The HTML markup uses the `Label` and `PrimaryButton` components from Fabric React and specifies that when the `onClick` event fires, the `insertText` function will run.

## Add the React component to your add-in

Add the `ButtonPrimaryExample` component to your add-in by opening **src\components\App.tsx** and completing the following steps:

1. Add the following import statement to reference `ButtonPrimaryExample` from **Button.tsx**.

    ```typescript
    import {ButtonPrimaryExample} from './Button';
    ```

2. Remove the following two import statements.

    ```typescript
    import { Button, ButtonType } from 'office-ui-fabric-react';
    ...
    import Progress from './Progress';
    ```

3. Replace the default `render()` function with the following code that uses `ButtonPrimaryExample`.

    ```typescript
    render() {
      return (
        <div className="ms-welcome">
        <Header logo="assets/logo-filled.png" title={this.props.title} message="Welcome" />
        <HeroList message="Discover what this add-in can do for you today!" items={this.state.listItems} >
          <ButtonPrimaryExample />
        </HeroList>
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

4. Save the changes you've made to **App.tsx**.

## See the result

In Word, the add-in task pane automatically updates when you save changes to **App.tsx**. The default text and button at the bottom of the task pane now shows the UI that's defined by the `ButtonPrimaryExample` component. Choose the **Insert text...** button to insert text into the document.

Congratulations, you've successfully created a task pane add-in using React and Office UI Fabric React!
