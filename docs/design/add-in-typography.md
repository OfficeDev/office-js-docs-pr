# Typography

Segoe is the standard typeface for Office. Use it in your add-in to align with Office task panes, dialog boxes, and content objects. [Fabric Core](fabric-core.md) gives you access to Segoe. It provides a full type ramp of Segoe with many variations - across font weight and size - in convenient CSS classes. Not all Fabric Core sizes and weights will look great in an Office Add-in. To fit harmoniously or avoid conflicts, consider using a subset of the Fabric Core type ramp. The following table lists Fabric Core's base classes that we recommend for use in Office Add-ins.

> [!NOTE]
> Text color is not included in these base classes. Use Fabric Core's "neutral primary" for most text on white backgrounds.
