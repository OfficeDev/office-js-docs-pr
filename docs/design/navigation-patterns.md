# Navigation
The main features of an add-in are accessed through specific command types and limited screen area. It is important that navigation is intuitive and allows the user to move easily throughout the add-in.

## Best practices
|Do                                                       |Don't                                                            |
|:------------------------------------------------------- |:----------------------------------------------------------------|
|Ensure the user has a clearly visible navigation option. |Don't complicate the navigation process by using non-standard UI.|
Utilize the following components as applicable to allow users to navigate through your add-in.

## Back Button

The back button allows users to recover from a drill down navigational action. This pattern helps ensure users follow an ordered series of steps.
