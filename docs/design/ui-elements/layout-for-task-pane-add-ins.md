# Layout for task pane containers


Create a consistent look and feel for task pane containers by using the recommended design layout. The recommended layout for a task pane includes the following elements: 

- Navigation element (optional) - Include a navigation bar or pivot in a bar under the brand element, if you're using one, with a maximum height of 80 pixels.
- Add-in content
- Branding element (optional)

You can also add [custom HTML-based UI](ui-elements.md#custom-html-based-ui) to your task pane.

For a sample that shows how to use Office UI Fabric in Office Add-ins, see [Office Add-in Fabric UI Sample](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-Fabric-UI-Sample).

<!-- Add sample template for content add-in and individual building blocks - Branding, Navigation bar or pivot, input, layout components -->
