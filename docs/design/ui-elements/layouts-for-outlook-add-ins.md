# Layouts for mail add-ins

You can use any of the following layouts for mail add-ins:

## Functions with InfoBar notifications

In addition to using a task pane or contextual pane to display custom HTML UI in your mail add-in, you can execute functions from commands. When you need to display UI text as a result of a function, you can use InfoBar notifications. For example, you might need to use an InfoBar notification to display error or success messages. 

For more information, see [add-in commands for mail](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/add-ins/add-in-commands-for-outlook).
