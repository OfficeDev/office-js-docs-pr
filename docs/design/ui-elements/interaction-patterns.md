# Interaction patterns for Office Add-ins


Office Add-ins can enhance authoring and productivity experiences as well as connect content in Office host applications to larger web-based workflows. A number of common scenarios apply to content, task pane, and Outlook add-ins that you might develop. This article describes some of the most common scenarios and provides recommended interaction patterns for the add-in UX. You can break down, combine, or mix and match these interaction patterns depending on your unique scenarios.

 **Common add-in scenarios**

| Add-in type | Common scenarios |
| ------ | ------ |
|  Content  |  Visualizing data <br> Widgets and tools  |
|  Task pane  |  Transforming and processing data <br> Authoring effectively and efficiently <br> Locating content and inserting data <br> Publishing or uploading content to a web service  |
|  Outlook  |  Bridging between mail content and an external application <br> Giving more information about the content in a mail message or appointment <br> Providing information that helps you be more productive  |

## Visualize data with a content add-in


This example shows a content add-in for Excel that generates a chart from data in a spreadsheet.

In this interaction pattern, the add-in doesn't become active until you select and bind data for generating the chart. It's important to communicate the purpose of the add-in and the steps for activating it in the initial view of the add-in.

<br>
<ul><li><p>To reinforce that you must perform an action before choosing the button, display instructions along with a disabled button (A).</p></li><li><p>After you select a range of cells, the <span class="ui">Create Chart</span> button becomes active (B - C).</p></li><li><p>The visualization fills out the container and replaces the previous view (D).</p></li><li><p>Display any additional UI at the bottom edge of the add-in along with a settings button (gear) to take you to a view where you can reset or manage the add-in.</p></li></ul>Best suited for:
<ul><li><p>Add-ins that require you to select data prior to activation.</p></li></ul>

## Transform content with a task pane add-in


This example shows a task pane add-in that translates text in your document into another language.

In this interaction pattern, you must first select the text you want to translate in the document.

After you select content in the document, these two elements become active (D).</p></li><li><p>After you choose <span class="ui">Translate</span>, the UI unfolds showing the translated content along with a button for inserting it back into the document (E).</p></li><li><p>You can provide a <span class="ui">Clear</span> or <span class="ui">Reset</span> button that returns to the initial view.</p></li></ul>Best suited for:
