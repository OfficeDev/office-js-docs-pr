> The following code uses ES6 JavaScript, which is not compatible with [older versions of Office that use the Internet Explorer 11 browser engine](/office/dev/add-ins/concepts/browsers-used-by-office-web-add-ins). For information on how to support those platforms, see [Support Internet Explorer 11](/office/dev/add-ins/develop/support-ie-11). You can also adapt the code in these instructions to use `var` instead of `let` or `const` and replace `await context.sync()` with `return content.sync().then(/* any subsequent code */)`.> [Join the Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/office/dev-program) to get a free, 90-day renewable Microsoft 365 subscription, with the latest Office applications, to use during development.
