### Microsoft 365 and Copilot store validation

The `validate` command also does Microsoft 365 and Copilot store validation but allows developer information like localhost URLs. If you'd like to run production-level Microsoft 365 and Copilot store validation, then run the following command.

```command&nbsp;line
npm run validate -- -p
```
