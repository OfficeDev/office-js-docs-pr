>[!NOTE]
> We recommend using custom functions with a [shared runtime](..testing/runtimes.md#shared-runtime), unless you have a specific reason not to use a shared runtime. Note that using a shared runtime means your add-in will use Microsoft Edge with WebView2 (Chromium-based) if conditions are met, and otherwise your add-in will use Internet Explorer 11 regardless of the Windows or Microsoft 365 version. For a description of the WebView2 conditions, see [Browsers used by Office Add-ins](../concepts/browsers-used-by-office-web-add-ins.md). For more information about runtimes, see [Runtimes](/javascript/api/manifest/runtimes).
