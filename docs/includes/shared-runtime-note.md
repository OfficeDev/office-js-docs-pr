>[!NOTE]
> Unless you have a specific reason to use a UI-less function, we recommend using custom functions with a [shared runtime](../develop/configure-your-add-in-to-use-a-shared-runtime.md). Note that using a shared runtime means your add-in will use Microsoft Edge with WebView2 (Chromium-based) if conditions are met, and otherwise your add-in will use Internet Explorer 11 regardless of the Windows or Microsoft 365 version. For a description of the WebView2 conditions, see [Browsers used by Office Add-ins](../concepts/browsers-used-by-office-web-add-ins.md). For more information about Runtimes, see [Runtimes](../reference/manifest/runtimes.md).
