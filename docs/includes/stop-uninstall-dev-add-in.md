When you want to stop the local web server and uninstall the add-in, follow the applicable instructions:

   - To stop the server, run the following command. If you used `npm start`, the following command also uninstalls the add-in.

     ```command&nbsp;line
     npm stop
     ```

   - If you manually sideloaded the add-in, see [Remove a sideloaded add-in](../testing/sideload-office-add-ins-for-testing.md#remove-a-sideloaded-add-in).
