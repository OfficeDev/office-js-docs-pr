> Beginning with Visual Studio 2026, Office Add-in development and publishing in Visual Studio is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Support for Office Add-in development in a different form may be added to a future version of Visual Studio.

> We recommend creating Office Add-in projects with the [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit](../develop/agents-toolkit-overview.md) or the [Yeoman Generator for Office Add-ins](../develop/yeoman-generator-overview.md).
