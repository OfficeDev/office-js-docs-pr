> - If your add-in runs in **Office on the web** in the Safari browser, the dialog and task pane don't share the same [local storage](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp), so it can't be used to communicate between them.
> - Starting in Version 115 of Chromium-based browsers, such as Chrome and Edge, [storage partitioning](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox/storage-partitioning/) is enabled to prevent specific side-channel cross-site tracking (see also [Microsoft Edge browser policies](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#defaultthirdpartystoragepartitioningsetting)). This means that data stored by storage APIs, such as local storage, are only available to contexts with the same origin and the same top-level site. Where possible, we recommend to pass data between the dialog and task pane using the [messageParent](/javascript/api/office/office.ui#office-office-ui-messageparent-member(1)) and [messageChild](/javascript/api/office/office.dialog#office-office-dialog-messagechild-member(1)) methods as described in [Use the Office dialog API in your Office Add-ins](../develop/dialog-api-in-office-add-ins.md).
