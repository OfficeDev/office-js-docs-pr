To require the Identity API set 1.3 in your Outlook add-in code, check if it's supported by calling `isSetSupported('IdentityAPI', '1.3')`. Declaring it in the Outlook add-in's manifest isn't supported. You can also determine if the API is supported by checking that it's not `undefined`. For further details, see [Using APIs from later requirement sets](/javascript/api/requirement-sets/outlook-api-requirement-sets.md#using-apis-from-later-requirement-sets).
