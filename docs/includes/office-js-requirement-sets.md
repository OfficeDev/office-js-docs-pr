[Requirement sets](../develop/office-versions-and-requirement-sets.md) are named groups of API members. Requirement sets can be specific to Office hosts, such as the `ExcelApi 1.7` requirement set (a set of APIs that can only be used in Excel), or common to multiple hosts, such as the `DialogApi 1.1` requirement set (a set of APIs that can be used in any Office application that supports the Dialog API).

Your add-in can use requirement sets to determine whether the Office host supports the API members that it needs to use. For more information about this, see [Specify Office hosts and API requirements](../develop/specify-office-hosts-and-api-requirements.md).

Requirement set support varies by Office host, version, and platform. For detailed information about the platforms, requirement sets, and Common APIs that each Office application supports, see [Office Add-in host and platform availability](../overview/office-add-in-availability.md).
