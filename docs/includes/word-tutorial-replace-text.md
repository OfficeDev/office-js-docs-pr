In this step of the tutorial, you'll add text inside and outside of selected ranges of text, and replace the text of a selected range.

## Add text inside a range

1. Open the project in your code editor.
2. Open the file index.html.
3. Below the `div` that contains the `change-font` button, add the following markup:

    ```html
    <div class="padding">
        <button class="ms-Button" id="insert-text-into-range">Insert Abbreviation</button>
    </div>
    ```

4. Open the app.js file.

5. Below the line that assigns a click handler to the `change-font` button, add the following code:

    ```js
    $('#insert-text-into-range').click(insertTextIntoRange);
    ```

6. Below the `changeFont` function, add the following function:

    ```js
    function insertTextIntoRange() {
        Word.run(function (context) {

            // TODO1: Queue commands to insert text into a selected range.

            // TODO2: Load the text of the range and sync so that the
            //        current range text can be read.

            // TODO3: Queue commands to repeat the text of the original
            //        range at the end of the document.

            return context.sync();
        })
        .catch(function (error) {
            console.log("Error: " + error);
            if (error instanceof OfficeExtension.Error) {
                console.log("Debug info: " + JSON.stringify(error.debugInfo));
            }
        });
    }
    ``` 

7. Replace `TODO1` with the following code. Note:
   - The method is intended to insert the abbreviation ["(C2R)"] into the end of the Range whose text is "Click-to-Run". It makes a simplifying assumption that the string is present and the user has selected it.
   - The first parameter of the `Range.insertText` method is the string to insert into the `Range` object.
   - The second parameter specifies where in the range the additional text should be inserted. Besides "End", the other possible options are "Start", "Before", "After", and "Replace". 
   - The difference between "End" and "After" is that "End" inserts the new text inside the end of the existing range, but "After" creates a new range with the string and inserts the new range after the existing range. Similarly, "Start" inserts text inside the beginning of the existing range and "Before" inserts a new range. "Replace" replaces the text of the existing range with the string in the first parameter.
   - You saw in an earlier stage of the tutorial that the insert* methods of the body object do not have the "Before" and "After" options. This is because you can't put content outside of the document's body.

    ```js
    const doc = context.document;
    const originalRange = doc.getSelection();
    originalRange.insertText(" (C2R)", "End");
    ```

8. We'll skip over `TODO2` until the next section. Replace `TODO3` with the following code. This code is similar to the code you created in the first stage of the tutorial, except that now you are inserting a new paragraph at the end of the document instead of at the start. This new paragraph will demonstrate that the new text is now part of the original range.

    ```js
    doc.body.insertParagraph("Original range: " + originalRange.text,
                             "End");
    ```

## Add code to fetch document properties into the task pane's script objects

In all the previous functions in this series of tutorials, you queued commands to *write* to the Office document. Each function ended with a call to the `context.sync()` method which sends the queued commands to the document to be executed. But the code you added in the last step calls the `originalRange.text` property, and this is a significant difference from the earlier functions you wrote, because the `originalRange` object is only a proxy object that exists in your task pane's script. It doesn't know what the actual text of the range in the document is, so its `text` property can't have a real value. It is necessary to first fetch the text value of the range from the document and use it to set the value of `originalRange.text`. Only then can `originalRange.text` be called without causing an exception to be thrown. This fetching process has three steps:

   1. Queue a command to load (that is; fetch) the properties that your code needs to read.
   2. Call the context object's `sync` method to send the queued command to the document for execution and return the requested information.
   3. Because the `sync` method is asynchronous, ensure that it has completed before your code calls the properties that were fetched.

These steps must be completed whenever your code needs to *read* information from the Office document.

1. Replace `TODO2` with the following code.
  
    ```js
    originalRange.load("text");
    return context.sync()
        .then(function() {

                // TODO4: Move the doc.body.insertParagraph line here.

            }
        )
            // TODO5: Move the final call of context.sync here and ensure
            //        that it does not run until the insertParagraph has
            //        been queued.
    ```

2. You can't have two `return` statements in the same unbranching code path, so delete the final line `return context.sync();` at the end of the `Word.run`. You'll add a new final `context.sync` later in this tutorial.
3. Cut the `doc.body.insertParagraph` line and paste in place of `TODO4`.
4. Replace `TODO5` with the following code. Note:
   - Passing the `sync` method to a `then` function ensures that it does not run until the `insertParagraph` logic has been queued.
   - The `then` method invokes whatever function is passed to it, and you don't want `sync` to be invoked twice, so leave off the "()" from the end of context.sync.

    ```js
    .then(context.sync);
    ```

When you are done, the entire function should look like the following:


```js
function insertTextIntoRange() {
    Word.run(function (context) {

        const doc = context.document;
        const originalRange = doc.getSelection();
        originalRange.insertText(" (C2R)", "End");

        originalRange.load("text");
        return context.sync()
            .then(function() {
                        doc.body.insertParagraph("Current text of original range: " + originalRange.text,
                                                "End");
                }
            )
            .then(context.sync);
    })
    .catch(function (error) {
        console.log("Error: " + error);
        if (error instanceof OfficeExtension.Error) {
            console.log("Debug info: " + JSON.stringify(error.debugInfo));
        }
    });
}
```

## Add text between ranges

1. Open the file index.html.
2. Below the `div` that contains the `insert-text-into-range` button, add the following markup:

    ```html
    <div class="padding">
        <button class="ms-Button" id="insert-text-outside-range">Add Version Info</button>
    </div>
    ```

3. Open the app.js file.

4. Below the line that assigns a click handler to the `insert-text-into-range` button, add the following code:

    ```js
    $('#insert-text-outside-range').click(insertTextBeforeRange);
    ```

5. Below the `insertTextIntoRange` function, add the following function:

    ```js
    function insertTextBeforeRange() {
        Word.run(function (context) {

            // TODO1: Queue commands to insert a new range before the
            //        selected range.

            // TODO2: Load the text of the original range and sync so that the
            //        range text can be read and inserted.

        })
        .catch(function (error) {
            console.log("Error: " + error);
            if (error instanceof OfficeExtension.Error) {
                console.log("Debug info: " + JSON.stringify(error.debugInfo));
            }
        });
    }
    ```

6. Replace `TODO1` with the following code. Note:
   - The method is intended to add a range whose text is "Office 2019, " before the range with text "Office 365". It makes a simplifying assumption that the string is present and the user has selected it.
   - The first parameter of the `Range.insertText` method is the string to add.
   - The second parameter specifies where in the range the additional text should be inserted. For more details about the location options, see the previous discussion of the `insertTextIntoRange` function.

    ```js
    const doc = context.document;
    const originalRange = doc.getSelection();
    originalRange.insertText("Office 2019, ", "Before");
    ```

7. Replace `TODO2` with the following code.

     ```js
    originalRange.load("text");
    return context.sync()
        .then(function() {

                // TODO3: Queue commands to insert the original range as a
                //        paragraph at the end of the document.

                }
            )

            // TODO4: Make a final call of context.sync here and ensure
            //        that it does not run until the insertParagraph has
            //        been queued.
    ```

8. Replace `TODO3` with the following code. This new paragraph will demonstrate the fact that the new text is ***not*** part of the original selected range. The original range still has only the text it had when it was selected.

    ```js
    doc.body.insertParagraph("Current text of original range: " + originalRange.text,
                             "End");
    ```

9. Replace `TODO4` with the following code:

    ```js
    .then(context.sync);
    ```


## Replace the text of a range

1. Open the file index.html.
2. Below the `div` that contains the `insert-text-outside-range` button, add the following markup:

    ```html
    <div class="padding">
        <button class="ms-Button" id="replace-text">Change Quantity Term</button>
    </div>
    ```

3. Open the app.js file.

4. Below the line that assigns a click handler to the `insert-text-outside-range` button, add the following code:

    ```js
    $('#replace-text').click(replaceText);
    ```

5. Below the `insertTextBeforeRange` function, add the following function:

    ```js
    function replaceText() {
        Word.run(function (context) {

            // TODO1: Queue commands to replace the text.

            return context.sync();
        })
        .catch(function (error) {
            console.log("Error: " + error);
            if (error instanceof OfficeExtension.Error) {
                console.log("Debug info: " + JSON.stringify(error.debugInfo));
            }
        });
    }
    ```

6. Replace `TODO1` with the following code. Note that the method is intended to replace the string "several" with the string "many". It makes a simplifying assumption that the string is present and the user has selected it.

    ```js
    const doc = context.document;
    const originalRange = doc.getSelection();
    originalRange.insertText("many", "Replace");
    ```

## Test the add-in

1. If the Git bash window, or Node.JS-enabled system prompt, from the previous stage tutorial is still open, enter Ctrl-C twice to stop the running web server. Otherwise, open a Git bash window, or Node.JS-enabled system prompt, and navigate to the **Start** folder of the project.

     > [!NOTE]
     > Although the browser-sync server reloads your add-in in the task pane every time you make a change to any file, including the app.js file, it does not retranspile the JavaScript, so you must repeat the build command in order for your changes to app.js to take effect. In order to do this, you need to kill the server process so that the prompt appears and you can enter the build command. After the build, restart the server. The next few steps carry out this process.

2. Run the command `npm run build` to transpile your ES6 source code to an earlier version of JavaScript that is supported by all the hosts where Office Add-ins can run.
3. Run the command `npm start` to start a web server running on localhost.
4. Reload the task pane by closing it, and then on the **Home** menu, select **Show Taskpane** to reopen the add-in.
5. In the task pane, choose **Insert Paragraph** to ensure that there is a paragraph at the start of the document.
6. Select some text. Selecting the phrase "Click-to-Run" will make the most sense. *Be careful not to include the preceding or following space in the selection.*
7. Choose the **Insert Abbreviation** button. Note that " (C2R)" is added. Note also that at the bottom of the document a new paragraph is added with the entire expanded text because the new string was added to the existing range.
8. Select some text. Selecting the phrase "Office 365" will make the most sense. *Be careful not to include the preceding or following space in the selection.*
9. Choose the **Add Version Info** button. Note that "Office 2019, " is inserted between "Office 2016" and "Office 365". Note also that at the bottom of the document a new paragraph is added but it contains only the originally selected text because the new string became a new range rather than being added to the original range.
10. Select some text. Selecting the word "several" will make the most sense. *Be careful not to include the preceding or following space in the selection.*
11. Choose the **Change Quantity Term** button. Note that "many" replaces the selected text.
