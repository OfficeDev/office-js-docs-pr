> [!NOTE]
> Office Add-ins that use the unified manifest for Microsoft 365 are *directly* supported in Office on the web, in [new Outlook on Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/office/656bb8d9-5a60-49b2-a98b-ba7822bc7627), and in Office on Windows connected to a Microsoft 365 subscription, Version 2304 (Build 16320.00000) or later.
>
> When the app package that contains the unified manifest is deployed in [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/) or the [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](../publish/publish.md) then, if the manifest has a valid "alternateIcons" property, an add-in only manifest is generated from the unified manifest and stored. This add-in only manifest enables the add-in to be installed on platforms that don't directly support the unified manifest, including Office on Mac, Office on mobile, subscription versions of Office on Windows earlier than 2304 (Build 16320.00000), and perpetual versions of Office on Windows.
