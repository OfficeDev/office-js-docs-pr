* A Microsoft 365 account. If you don't already have a Microsoft 365 account, you can get a free, 90-day renewable Microsoft 365 subscription by joining the [Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/office/dev-program). 

* An Insider's build of Microsoft 365. You should use the latest monthly version and build from the Insiders channel but you need to [be an Office Insider](https://insider.office.com) to get this version.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When a build graduates to the production semi-annual channel, support for preview features, including SSO, is disabled for that build.
