An Excel add-in interacts with objects in Excel by using the [Office JavaScript API](../reference/javascript-api-for-office.md), which includes two JavaScript object models:

- **Excel JavaScript API**: Introduced with Office 2016, the [Excel JavaScript API](../reference/overview/excel-add-ins-reference-overview.md) provides strongly-typed Excel objects that you can use to access worksheets, ranges, tables, charts, and more.

- **Common API**: Introduced with Office 2013, the Common API enables you to access features such as UI, dialogs, and client settings that are common across multiple types of Office applications. The limited functionality for Excel interaction in the Common API has been replaced by the Excel JavaScript API.
