> - You must use the preview version of the Office JavaScript API library from the [Office.js content delivery network (CDN)](https://appsforoffice.microsoft.com/lib/beta/hosted/office.js). The [type definition file](https://appsforoffice.microsoft.com/lib/beta/hosted/office.d.ts) for TypeScript compilation and IntelliSense is found at the CDN and [DefinitelyTyped](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/master/types/office-js-preview/index.d.ts). You can install these types with `npm install --save-dev @types/office-js-preview`.
> - You may need to join the [Microsoft 365 Insider program](https://aka.ms/MSFT365InsiderProgram) for access to more recent Office builds.
