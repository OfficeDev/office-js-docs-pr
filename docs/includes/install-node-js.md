### Install Node.js and npm

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime you use to develop modern Office Add-ins.

Install Node.js by [downloading the latest recommended version from their website](https://nodejs.org). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

npm is an open source software registry from which to download the packages used in developing Office Add-ins. It's usually installed automatically when you install Node.js. To check if you already have npm installed and see the installed version, run the following in the command line.

```command&nbsp;line
npm -v
```

If, for any reason, you want to install it manually, run the following in the command line.

```command&nbsp;line
npm install npm -g
```

> [!TIP]
> You may wish to use a Node version manager to allow you to switch between multiple versions of Node.js and npm, but this isn't strictly necessary. For details on how to do this, [see npm's instructions](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
