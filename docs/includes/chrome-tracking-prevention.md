## Google Chrome third-party cookie support

Google Chrome is working to give users more control of their browsing experience. Users will be able to block third-party cookies in their Chrome browser. This will prevent your add-in from using any such cookies. This may cause issues when the add-in authenticates the user, such as multiple sign-on requests or errors.

For improved authentication experiences, see [Using device state for an improved SSO experience on browsers with blocked third-party cookies](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/identity/managed-devices-for-blocked-third-party-cookies/).

For more information about the Google Chrome rollout, see [A new path for Privacy Sandbox on the web](https://privacysandbox.com/news/privacy-sandbox-update).
