## Google Chrome 3rd party cookie support

Google Chrome is phasing out 3rd party cookies in 2024 and introducing a feature named Tracking Prevention. If Tracking Prevention is enabled in the Chrome browser, your add-in will not be able to use any 3rd party cookies. Your add-in may encounter issues when authenticating the user, such as multiple sign-on requests, or errors.

For improved authentication experiences, see [Using device state for an improved SSO experience on browsers with blocked third-party cookies]( https://devblogs.microsoft.com/identity/managed-devices-for-blocked-third-party-cookies/).
