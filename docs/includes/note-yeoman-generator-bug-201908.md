> Due to a bug in the Yeoman generator for Office Add-ins, spaces are not currently allowed in the add-in name or anywhere in the folder path where you create your add-in project. If your add-in's project name or folder path contains spaces, the local web server won't start when you run `npm start` or `npm run start:web`.
