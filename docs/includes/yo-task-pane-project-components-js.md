The add-in project that you've created with the Yeoman generator contains sample code for a basic task pane add-in. If you'd like to explore the components of your add-in project, open the project in your code editor and review the files listed below. When you're ready to try out your add-in, proceed to the next section.

- The **./manifest.xml** file in the root directory of the project defines the settings and capabilities of the add-in. To learn more about the **manifest.xml** file, see [Office Add-ins XML manifest](../develop/add-in-manifests.md).
- The **./src/taskpane/taskpane.html** file contains the HTML markup for the task pane.
- The **./src/taskpane/taskpane.css** file contains the CSS that's applied to content in the task pane.
- The **./src/taskpane/taskpane.js** file contains the Office JavaScript API code that facilitates interaction between the task pane and the Office client application.
