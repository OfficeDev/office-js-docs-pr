> Although it's possible to create Office Add-ins using Visual Studio, using the Yeoman generator provides a better developer experience in some notable ways.
> 
> * The Yeoman generator provides a wider range of options for project types, frameworks, and languages than Visual Studio does for Office Add-in projects.
> 
> * Project templates in the Yeoman generator are updated more frequently than project templates in Visual Studio.
