> The unified manifest for Microsoft 365 enables you to combine an Outlook add-in with a Teams app into an App for Microsoft 365 as a single unit of development and deployment. We're working to extend support for the unified manifest to Excel, PowerPoint, Word, custom Copilot development, and other extensions of Microsoft 365. For more about it, see [Office Add-ins with the unified manifest](../develop/unified-manifest-overview.md). For a sample of an App for Microsoft 365 that combines a Teams app and Outlook add-in, see [Discount Offers](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/tree/main/samples/tab-add-in-combined/nodejs).
