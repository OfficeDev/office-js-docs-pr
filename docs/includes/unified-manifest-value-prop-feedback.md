> The unified manifest for Microsoft 365 enables you to combine an Outlook Add-in with a Teams app as a single unit of development and deployment. We're working to extend support for the unified manifest to Excel, PowerPoint, Word, custom Copilot development, and other extensions of Microsoft 365. For more about it, see [Office Add-ins with the unified manifest](../develop/unified-manifest-overview.md). For a sample of a combined Teams app and Outlook Add-in, see [Discount Offers](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/tree/main/samples/tab-add-in-combined/nodejs).

> We love to get your feedback about the unified manifest. If you have any suggestions, please create an issue in the repo for the [Office JavaScript Library](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js/issues).
