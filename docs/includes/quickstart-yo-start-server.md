1. Open a bash terminal in the root of the project (**[...]/My Office Add-in**) and run the following command to start the dev server.

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Office Web Add-ins should use HTTPS, not HTTP, even when you are developing. If you are prompted to install a certificate after you run `npm start`, accept the prompt to install the certificate that Yo Office provides.
