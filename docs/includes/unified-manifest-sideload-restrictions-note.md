> Currently, an add-in that uses the [Unified manifest for Microsoft 365](../develop/json-manifest-overview.md) can't be sideloaded on Mac or iPad. If you work on a Mac, you can test the add-in by having your Microsoft 365 administrator deploy the add-in as an [integrated app](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/test-and-deploy-microsoft-365-apps) in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center.
