> Legacy Exchange Online [user identity tokens](../outlook/authentication.md#exchange-user-identity-token) and [callback tokens](../outlook/authentication.md#callback-tokens) are no longer supported and turned off across all Microsoft 365 tenants. If an Outlook add-in requires delegated user access or user identity, we recommend using [MSAL (Microsoft Authentication Library) and nested app authentication](../develop/enable-nested-app-authentication-in-your-add-in.md). Exchange user identity tokens are still supported for Exchange on-premises.
