> Legacy Exchange tokens are deprecated. Starting October 2024, legacy Exchange  [user identity](../outlook/authentication.md#exchange-user-identity-token) and [callback](../outlook/authentication.md#callback-tokens) tokens will begin to be turned off for Exchange Online tenants. For the timeline and details, see our [FAQ page](../outlook/faq-nested-app-auth-outlook-legacy-tokens.md). This is part of [Microsoft's Secure Future Initiative](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/11/02/secure-future-initiative-sfi-cybersecurity-cyberattacks/), which gives organizations the tools needed to respond to the current threat landscape. Exchange user identity tokens will still work for Exchange on-premises. Nested app authentication is the recommended approach for tokens going forward.
