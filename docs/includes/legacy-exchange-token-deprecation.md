> Legacy Exchange user identity tokens and callback tokens will be turned off for all Exchange Online tenants in October 2024 as part of [Microsoftâ€™s Secure Future Initiative](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/11/02/secure-future-initiative-sfi-cybersecurity-cyberattacks/), which gives organizations the tools needed to respond to the current threat landscape. Exchange user identity tokens will still work for Exchange on-premises. Nested app authentication is the recommended approach for tokens going forward. For more information, see our [blog post about nested app authentication and legacy Exchange tokens](https://aka.ms/NAApreviewblog).
