> [!NOTE]
> The `OnSensitivityLabelChanged` event isn't currently available with the unified manifest for Microsoft 365 in Outlook on the web and the new Outlook on Windows. To handle these events, implement an add-in only manifest instead. For information about the types of manifests, see [Office Add-ins manifest](../develop/add-in-manifests.md).
