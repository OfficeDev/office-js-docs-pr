> - When you first use Yeoman generator to develop an Office Add-in, your default browser opens a window where you'll be prompted to sign in to your Microsoft 365 account. If a sign-in window doesn't appear and you encounter a sideloading or login timeout error, run `atk auth login m365` before running `npm start` again.
>
> If your add-in wasn't automatically sideloaded, follow the instructions in [Sideload Outlook add-ins for testing](../outlook/sideload-outlook-add-ins-for-testing.md#sideload-manually) to manually sideload the add-in in Outlook.
