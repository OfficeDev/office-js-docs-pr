You can create an Office Add-in by using the [Yeoman generator for Office Add-ins](https://github.com/OfficeDev/generator-office) or Visual Studio. The Yeoman generator creates a Node.js project that can be managed with Visual Studio Code or any other editor, whereas Visual Studio creates a Visual Studio solution. Select the tab for the one you'd like to use and then follow the instructions to create your add-in and test it locally.
