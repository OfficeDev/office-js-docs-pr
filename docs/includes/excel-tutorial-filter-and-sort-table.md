In this step of the tutorial, you'll filter and sort the table that you created previously.

## Filter the table

1. Open the project in your code editor. 
2. Open the file index.html.
3. Just below the `div` that contains the `create-table` button, add the following markup:

    ```html
    <div class="padding">            
        <button class="ms-Button" id="filter-table">Filter Table</button>            
    </div>
    ```

4. Open the app.js file.

5. Just below the line that assigns a click handler to the `create-table` button, add the following code:

    ```js
    $('#filter-table').click(filterTable);
    ```

6. Just below the `createTable` function, add the following function:

    ```js
    function filterTable() {
        Excel.run(function (context) {
            
            // TODO1: Queue commands to filter out all expense categories except 
            //        Groceries and Education.

            return context.sync();
        })
        .catch(function (error) {
            console.log("Error: " + error);
            if (error instanceof OfficeExtension.Error) {
                console.log("Debug info: " + JSON.stringify(error.debugInfo));
            }
        });
    }
    ``` 

7. Replace `TODO1` with the following code. Note:
   - The code first gets a reference to the column that needs filtering by passing the column name to the `getItem` method, instead of passing its index to the `getItemAt` method as the `createTable` method does. Since users can move table columns, the column at a given index might change after the table is created. Hence, it is safer to use the column name to get a reference to the column. We used `getItemAt` safely in the preceding tutorial, because we used it in the very same method that creates the table, so there is no chance that a user has moved the column.
   - The `applyValuesFilter` method is one of several filtering methods on the `Filter` object.

    ```js
    const currentWorksheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getActiveWorksheet();
    const expensesTable = currentWorksheet.tables.getItem('ExpensesTable');
    const categoryFilter = expensesTable.columns.getItem('Category').filter;
    categoryFilter.applyValuesFilter(["Education", "Groceries"]);
    ``` 

## Sort the table

1. Open the file index.html.
2. Below the `div` that contains the `filter-table` button, add the following markup:

    ```html
    <div class="padding">            
        <button class="ms-Button" id="sort-table">Sort Table</button>            
    </div>
    ```

3. Open the app.js file.

4. Below the line that assigns a click handler to the `filter-table` button, add the following code:

    ```js
    $('#sort-table').click(sortTable);
    ```

5. Below the `filterTable` function add the following function.

    ```js
    function sortTable() {
        Excel.run(function (context) {
            
            // TODO1: Queue commands to sort the table by Merchant name.

            return context.sync();
        })
        .catch(function (error) {
            console.log("Error: " + error);
            if (error instanceof OfficeExtension.Error) {
                console.log("Debug info: " + JSON.stringify(error.debugInfo));
            }
        });
    }
    ``` 

7. Replace `TODO1` with the following code. Note:
   - The code creates an array of `SortField` objects which has just one member since the add-in only sorts on the Merchant column.
   - The `key` property of a `SortField` object is the zero-based index of the column to sort-on.
   - The `sort` member of a `Table` is a `TableSort` object, not a method. The `SortField`s are passed the `TableSort` object's `apply` method.

    ```js
    const currentWorksheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getActiveWorksheet();
    const expensesTable = currentWorksheet.tables.getItem('ExpensesTable');
    const sortFields = [
        { 
            key: 1,            // Merchant column
            ascending: false,
        }
    ];

    expensesTable.sort.apply(sortFields);
    ``` 

## Test the add-in

1. If the Git bash window, or Node.JS-enabled system prompt, from the previous stage tutorial is still open, enter Ctrl-C twice to stop the running web server. Otherwise, open a Git bash window, or Node.JS-enabled system prompt, and navigate to the **Start** folder of the project.

     > [!NOTE]
     > Although the browser-sync server reloads your add-in in the task pane every time you make a change to any file, including the app.js file, it does not retranspile the JavaScript, so you must repeat the build command in order for your changes to app.js to take effect. In order to do this, you need to kill the server process in so that you can get a prompt to enter the build command. After the build, you restart the server. The next few steps carry out this process.

1. Run the command `npm run build` to transpile your ES6 source code to an earlier version of JavaScript that is supported by Internet Explorer (which is used under-the-hood by Excel to run Excel add-ins).
2. Run the command `npm start` to start a web server running on localhost.
4. Reload the task pane by closing it, and then on the **Home** menu, select **Show Taskpane** to reopen the add-in.
5. If for any reason the table is not in the open worksheet, in the taskpane, choose **Create Table**. 
6. Choose the **Filter Table** and **Sort Table** buttons, in either order.
