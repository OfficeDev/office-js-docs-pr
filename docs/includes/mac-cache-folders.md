If that folder doesn't exist, check for the existence of the following folders and if found, delete the contents of the folder:
    - `~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.{host}/Data/Library/Caches/` (where `{host}` is the Office host; e.g., `Excel`)
    - `com.microsoft.Office365ServiceV2/Data/Caches/com.microsoft.Office365ServiceV2/`
