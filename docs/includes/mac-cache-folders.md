If that folder doesn't exist, check for the existence of the following folders and if found, delete the contents of the folder:

- `~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.{host}/Data/Library/Caches/` (where `host` is the Office host; e.g., for Excel: `~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Excel/Data/Library/Caches/`)

- `com.microsoft.Office365ServiceV2/Data/Caches/com.microsoft.Office365ServiceV2/`
