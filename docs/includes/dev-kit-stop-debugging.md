## Stop testing your Office Add-in

Once you are finished testing and debugging the add-in, *always* close the add-in by following these steps. (Closing the Office application or web server window doesn't reliably deregister the add-in.)

1. Open the extension by selecting the Office Add-ins Development Kit icon in the **Activity Bar**.
1. Select **Stop Previewing Your Office Add-in**. This closes the web server and removes the add-in from the registry and cache.
1. Close the Office application window.
