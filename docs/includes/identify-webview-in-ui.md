In recent versions of Office, you can identify the webview control that is being used through the [personality menu](../design/task-pane-add-ins.md#personality-menu) on any add-in where it is available. (The personality menu is not supported in Outlook.) Open the menu and select **Security Info**. In the **Security Info** dialog on Windows, the **Runtime** reports **Microsoft Edge**, **Microsoft Edge Legacy**, or **Internet Explorer**. The runtime isn't included on the dialog in older versions of Office. 

Note that right-clicking a task pane in an add-in opens a context menu if Microsoft Edge (Chromium) is being used. If it is not, then right-clicking does nothing.
