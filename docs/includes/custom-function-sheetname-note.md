> If a blank space or any of the following characters is in a worksheet name: **~ \` ! @ # $ % ^ & ( ) - _ = + { } | ; : , < . >**, then the worksheet name in the returned address is enclosed in single quotation marks, so the format is `'SheetName'!RelativeCellAddress`; for example, `'Latest Prices'!F6`.
