> [!NOTE]
> If a blank space or any of the following characters is in a worksheet name: **~ \` ! @ # $ % ^ & ( ) - _ = + { } | ; : , ' < . >**, then the worksheet name in the returned address is enclosed in single quotation marks, so the format is `'SheetName'!RelativeCellAddress`; for example, `'Latest Prices'!F6`. If the single quotation mark (apostrophe) character, ', is in the name, the returned address has two such characters in a row; for example, `'Bob''s Region'!F6`.
