> [!NOTE]
> While Fabric Core is the recommended library to design non-React add-ins, the team is working on [Fluent UI Web Components](/fluent-ui/web-components/) to provide a newer solution. Built on [FAST](https://www.fast.design/), the Fluent UI Web Components library allows you to use, customize, and build Web Components to create a more modern and standards-based UI. We invite you to test this library by [completing the quick start](/fluent-ui/web-components/getting-started/quick-start) and welcome feedback on your experience through [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aweb-components).
