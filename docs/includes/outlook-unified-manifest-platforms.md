> Add-ins that use the unified manifest for Microsoft 365 aren't directly supported in Outlook on Mac and on mobile devices. To run this type of add-in on Mac and on mobile platforms, the add-in must first be published to [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/). For more information, see the "Client and platform support" section of [Office Add-ins with the unified app manifest for Microsoft 365](../develop/unified-manifest-overview.md#client-and-platform-support).
