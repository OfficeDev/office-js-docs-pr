> [!NOTE]
> Add-ins that use the unified manifest for Microsoft 365 aren't directly supported in Outlook on Mac and on mobile devices. To run this type of add-in on Mac and on mobile platforms, the add-in must first be published to [Microsoft Marketplace](https://marketplace.microsoft.com/) then deployed in the [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](../publish/publish.md). For more information, see the "Client and platform support" section of [Office Add-ins with the unified app manifest for Microsoft 365](../develop/unified-manifest-overview.md#client-and-platform-support).
