> [!NOTE]
> Add-ins that use the unified manifest for Microsoft 365 aren't supported in Outlook on Mac and on mobile devices. We're working hard to provide support in Mac and mobile devices. In the meantime, to support these platforms, you need to create a version of your add-in that uses the add-in only manifest and then deploy and maintain both versions. For more information, see the "Client and platform support" section of [Office Add-ins with the unified app manifest for Microsoft 365](../develop/unified-manifest-overview.md#client-and-platform-support).
