> Add-ins that use the unified manifest for Microsoft 365 aren't directly supported in Outlook on Mac. To run this type of add-in on Mac, the add-in must first be published to [Microsoft Marketplace](https://marketplace.microsoft.com/) then deployed in the [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](../publish/publish.md). For more information, see [Support for add-ins with the unified manifest for Microsoft 365](../outlook/compare-outlook-add-in-support-in-outlook-for-mac.md#support-for-add-ins-with-the-unified-manifest-for-microsoft-365).
