[21Vianet operates and manages an Office 365 service powered by licensed Microsoft technologies](/microsoft-365/admin/services-in-china/services-in-china?view=o365-21vianet&preserve-view=true) to provide Office 365 services for China compliant with local laws and regulations. Add-ins developed for use within this cloud environment should use corresponding CDN. Use `https://appsforoffice.cdn.partner.office365.cn/appsforoffice/lib/1/hosted/office.js` instead of the [standard CDN reference](../develop/understanding-the-javascript-api-for-office.md#accessing-the-office-javascript-api-library). This ensures continued compliance and provides better add-in performance.
