## Troubleshooting

- Ensure your environment is ready for Office development by following the instructions in [Set up your development environment](../overview/set-up-your-dev-environment.md).

- Some of the sample code uses ES6 JavaScript. This isn't compatible with [older versions of Office that use the Trident (Internet Explorer 11) browser engine](/office/dev/add-ins/concepts/browsers-used-by-office-web-add-ins). For information on how to support those platforms in your add-in, see [Support older Microsoft webviews and Office versions](/office/dev/add-ins/develop/support-ie-11). If you don't already have a Microsoft 365 subscription to use for development, you might qualify for a Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription through the [Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://aka.ms/m365devprogram); for details, see the [FAQ](/office/developer-program/microsoft-365-developer-program-faq#who-qualifies-for-a-microsoft-365-e5-developer-subscription-). Alternatively, you can [sign up for a 1-month free trial](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/try) or [purchase a Microsoft 365 plan](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business/compare-all-microsoft-365-business-products-g).
