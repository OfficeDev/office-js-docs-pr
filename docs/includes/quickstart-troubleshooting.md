## Troubleshooting

Ensure your environment is ready for Office development by following the instructions in [Set up your development environment](../overview/set-up-your-dev-environment.md).

The automatic `npm install` step yo office performs may fail. If you see errors when trying to run `npm start`, navigate to the newly created project folder in a command prompt and manually run `npm install`. For more information about yo office, see [Create Office Add-in projects using the Yeoman Generator](../develop/yeoman-generator-overview.md).
