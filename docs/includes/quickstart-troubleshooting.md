## Troubleshooting

- Ensure your environment is ready for Office development by following the instructions in [Set up your development environment](../overview/set-up-your-dev-environment.md).

- The automatic `npm install` step Yo Office performs may fail. If you see errors when trying to run `npm start`, navigate to the newly created project folder in a command prompt and manually run `npm install`. For more information about Yo Office, see [Create Office Add-in projects using the Yeoman Generator](../develop/yeoman-generator-overview.md).

- If your add-in shows an error (for example, "This add-in could not be started. Close this dialog to ignore the problem or click "Restart" to try again.") when you press **F5** or choose **Debug** > **Start Debugging** in Visual Studio, see [Debug Office Add-ins in Visual Studio](../develop/debug-office-add-ins-in-visual-studio.md) for other debugging options.

- Some of the sample code uses ES6 JavaScript. This isn't compatible with [older versions of Office that use the Trident (Internet Explorer 11) browser engine](/office/dev/add-ins/concepts/browsers-used-by-office-web-add-ins). For information on how to support those platforms in your add-in, see [Support older Microsoft webviews and Office versions](/office/dev/add-ins/develop/support-ie-11). If you don't already have a Microsoft 365 subscription to use for development, you might qualify for a Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription through the [Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://aka.ms/m365devprogram); for details, see the [FAQ](/office/developer-program/microsoft-365-developer-program-faq#who-qualifies-for-a-microsoft-365-e5-developer-subscription-). Alternatively, you can [sign up for a 1-month free trial](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/try) or [purchase a Microsoft 365 plan](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/business/compare-all-microsoft-365-business-products-g).
