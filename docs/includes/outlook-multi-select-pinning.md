When you select multiple mail items and launch the multi-select add-in's task pane, the pinning behavior of the task pane varies depending on the Outlook client.
- **Mac**: The task pane stays open even when a user switches to a different mail item. The task pane can only be closed by selecting the **Close** button from the task pane.
- **Windows (new and classic) and web**: The task pane doesn't stay open when the user switches to a new item.
