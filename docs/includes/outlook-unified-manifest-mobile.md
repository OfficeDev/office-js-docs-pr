> [!NOTE]
> Add-ins that use the unified manifest for Microsoft 365 aren't supported in Outlook on mobile devices. We're working hard to provide that support. In the meantime, if your customer base includes users on mobile devices, you need to create a version of your add-in that uses the add-in only manifest and support them both. For more information, see [Support for add-ins with the unified manifest for Microsoft 365](../outlook/outlook-mobile-addins.md#support-for-add-ins-with-the-unified-manifest-for-microsoft-365).
