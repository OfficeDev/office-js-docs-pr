> [!IMPORTANT]
> Add-ins that use the [Smart Alerts feature](../outlook/onmessagesend-onappointmentsend-events.md) can only be published to AppSource if the manifest's send mode property is set to the **prompt user** or **soft block** option. If an add-in's send mode property is set to **block**, it can only be deployed by an organization's admin as it will fail AppSource validation.
