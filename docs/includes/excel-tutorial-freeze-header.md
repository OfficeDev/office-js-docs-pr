When a table is long enough that a user must scroll to see some rows, the header row can scroll out of sight. In this step of the tutorial, you'll freeze the header row of the table that you created previously, so that it remains visible even as the user scrolls down the worksheet.

## Freeze the table's header row

1. Open the project in your code editor.
2. Open the file index.html.
3. Below the `div` that contains the `create-chart` button, add the following markup:

    ```html
    <div class="padding">
        <button class="ms-Button" id="freeze-header">Freeze Header</button>
    </div>
    ```

4. Open the app.js file.

5. Below the line that assigns a click handler to the `create-chart` button, add the following code:

    ```js
    $('#freeze-header').click(freezeHeader);
    ```

6. Below the `createChart` function add the following function:

    ```js
    function freezeHeader() {
        Excel.run(function (context) {

            // TODO1: Queue commands to keep the header visible when the user scrolls.

            return context.sync();
        })
        .catch(function (error) {
            console.log("Error: " + error);
            if (error instanceof OfficeExtension.Error) {
                console.log("Debug info: " + JSON.stringify(error.debugInfo));
            }
        });
    }
    ```

7. Replace `TODO1` with the following code. Note:
   - The `Worksheet.freezePanes` collection is a set of panes in the worksheet that are pinned, or frozen, in place when the worksheet is scrolled.
   - The `freezeRows` method takes as a parameter the number of rows, from the top that are to be pinned in place. We pass `1` to pin the first row in place.

    ```js
    const currentWorksheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getActiveWorksheet();
    currentWorksheet.freezePanes.freezeRows(1);
    ```

## Test the add-in

1. If the Git bash window, or Node.JS-enabled system prompt, from the previous stage tutorial is still open, enter Ctrl-C twice to stop the running web server. Otherwise, open a Git bash window, or Node.JS-enabled system prompt, and navigate to the **Start** folder of the project.

     > [!NOTE]
     > Although the browser-sync server reloads your add-in in the task pane every time you make a change to any file, including the app.js file, it does not retranspile the JavaScript, so you must repeat the build command in order for your changes to app.js to take effect. In order to do this, you need to kill the server process in so that you can get a prompt to enter the build command. After the build, you restart the server. The next few steps carry out this process.

1. Run the command `npm run build` to transpile your ES6 source code to an earlier version of JavaScript that is supported by Internet Explorer (which is used under-the-hood by Excel to run Excel add-ins).
2. Run the command `npm start` to start a web server running on localhost.
4. Reload the task pane by closing it, and then on the **Home** menu, select **Show Taskpane** to reopen the add-in.
6. If the table is in the worksheet, delete it.
7. In the task pane, choose **Create Table**.
8. Choose the **Freeze Header** button.
9. Scroll down the worksheet enough to to see that the table header remains visible at the top even when the higher rows scroll out of sight.
