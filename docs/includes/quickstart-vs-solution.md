When you've completed the wizard, Visual Studio creates a solution that contains two projects.

|**Project**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Add-in project|Contains only an XML manifest file, which contains all the settings that describe your add-in. These settings help the Office application determine when your add-in should be activated and where the add-in should appear. Visual Studio generates the contents of this file for you so that you can run the project and use your add-in immediately. You change these settings any time by modifying the XML file.|
|Web application project|Contains the content pages of your add-in, including all the files and file references that you need to develop Office-aware HTML and JavaScript pages. While you develop your add-in, Visual Studio hosts the web application on your local IIS server. When you're ready to publish the add-in, you'll need to deploy this web application project to a web server.|
