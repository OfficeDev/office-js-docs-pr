# Activate your Outlook add-in on multiple messages

With the item multi-select feature, your Outlook add-in can now activate and perform operations on multiple selected messages in one go. Certain operations, such as uploading messages to your Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system or categorizing numerous items, can now be easily completed with a single click.

The following sections show how to configure your add-in to retrieve the subject line and sender's email address of multiple messages in read mode.

> [!NOTE]
> Support for the item multi-select feature was introduced in [requirement set 1.13](/javascript/api/requirement-sets/outlook/requirement-set-1.13/outlook-requirement-set-1.13), with additional item properties now available in subsequent requirement sets. See [clients and platforms](/javascript/api/requirement-sets/outlook/outlook-api-requirement-sets#requirement-sets-supported-by-exchange-servers-and-outlook-clients) that support this requirement set.

## Set up your environment

Complete the [Outlook quick start](../quickstarts/outlook-quickstart-yo.md) to create an add-in project with the [Yeoman generator for Office Add-ins](../develop/yeoman-generator-overview.md).

## Configure the manifest

# [Unified manifest for Microsoft 365](#tab/jsonmanifest)

1. In your preferred code editor, open the Outlook quick start project you created.

1. Open the **manifest.json** file located at the root of the project.

1. In the "authorization.permissions.resourceSpecific" array, change the value of the "name" property to "Mailbox.ReadWrite.User". It should look like the following when you're done.

    ```json
    "authorization": {
        "permissions": {
            "resourceSpecific": [
                {
                    "name": "Mailbox.ReadWrite.User",
                    "type": "Delegated"
                }
            ]
        }
    },
    ```

1. In first object of the "extensions.runtimes" array, make the following changes.

    1. Change the "requirements.capabilities.minVersion" property to "1.13".
    1. In the same "actions" object, add the "supportsNoItemContext" property and set it to `true`.
    1. In the same "actions" object, add the "multiselect" property and set it to `true`.

    Your code should look like the following after you've made the changes.

    ```json
    "runtimes": [
        {
            "requirements": {
                "capabilities": [
                    {
                        "name": "Mailbox",
                        "minVersion": "1.13"
                    }
                ]
            },
            "id": "TaskPaneRuntime",
            "type": "general",
            "code": {
                "page": "https://localhost:3000/taskpane.html"
            },
            "lifetime": "short",
            "actions": [
                {
                    "id": "TaskPaneRuntimeShow",
                    "type": "openPage",
                    "pinnable": false,
                    "view": "dashboard",
                    "supportsNoItemContext": true,
                    "multiselect": true
                }
            ]
        },
        ...
    ]
    ```

1. Delete the second object of the "extensions.runtimes" array, whose "id" is "CommandsRuntime".

1. In the "extensions.ribbons.tabs.controls" array, delete the second object, whose "id" is "ActionButton".

1. Save your changes.

# [Add-in only manifest](#tab/xmlmanifest)

To enable your add-in to activate on multiple selected messages, you must add the [SupportsMultiSelect](/javascript/api/manifest/action#supportsmultiselect) child element to the **\<Action\>** element and set its value to `true`. As item multi-select only supports messages at this time, the **\<ExtensionPoint\>** element's `xsi:type` attribute value must be set to `MessageReadCommandSurface` or `MessageComposeCommandSurface`.

1. In your preferred code editor, open the Outlook quick start project you created.

1. Open the **manifest.xml** file located at the root of the project.

1. Assign the **\<Permissions\>** element the `ReadWriteMailbox` value.

    ```xml
    <Permissions>ReadWriteMailbox</Permissions>
    ```

1. Select the entire **\<VersionOverrides\>** node and replace it with the following XML.

    ```xml
    <VersionOverrides xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/mailappversionoverrides" xsi:type="VersionOverridesV1_0">

---

> [!NOTE]
> If you turn on the item multi-select feature in your add-in, your add-in will automatically support the [no item context](contextless.md) feature, even if it isn't explicitly configured in the manifest. For more information on task pane pinning behavior in multi-select add-ins, see [Task pane pinning in multi-select add-ins](#task-pane-pinning-in-multi-select-add-ins).

## Configure the task pane

Item multi-select relies on the [SelectedItemsChanged](/javascript/api/office/office.eventtype) event to determine when messages are selected or deselected. This event requires a task pane implementation.

1. From the **./src/taskpane** folder, open **taskpane.html**.

1. In the **\<body\>** element, replace the entire **\<main\>** element with the following markup.

    ```html
    <main id="app-body" class="ms-welcome__main">
        <h2 class="ms-font-l">Get information about each selected message</h2>
        <ul id="selected-items"></ul>
        <div role="button" id="run" class="ms-welcome__action ms-Button ms-Button--hero ms-font-xl">
            <span class="ms-Button-label">Get information</span>
        </div>
    </main>
    ```

1. For classic Outlook on Windows only. Replace the existing **script** element with the following markup. This references the preview version of the Office JavaScript API.

    ```html
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://appsforoffice.microsoft.com/lib/beta/hosted/office.js"></script>
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > The preview version of the Office JavaScript API is used because this walkthrough implements the `loadItemByIdAsync` and `unloadAsync` methods, which are currently in preview. If your multi-select add-in doesn't implement these methods, use `https://appsforoffice.microsoft.com/lib/1.1/hosted/office.js` instead. For more information, see [Referencing the Office JavaScript API library](../develop/referencing-the-javascript-api-for-office-library-from-its-cdn.md).

1. Save your changes.

## Implement a handler for the SelectedItemsChanged event

To alert your add-in when the `SelectedItemsChanged` event occurs, you must register an event handler using the `addHandlerAsync` method.

1. From the **./src/taskpane** folder, open **taskpane.js**.

1. Replace the `Office.onReady()` function with the following:

    ```javascript
    let list;

    Office.onReady((info) => {
      if (info.host === Office.HostType.Outlook) {
        document.getElementById("sideload-msg").style.display = "none";
        document.getElementById("app-body").style.display = "flex";
        document.getElementById("run").onclick = run;
        list = document.getElementById("selected-items");

        // Register an event handler to identify when messages are selected.
        Office.context.mailbox.addHandlerAsync(Office.EventType.SelectedItemsChanged, run, (asyncResult) => {
          if (asyncResult.status === Office.AsyncResultStatus.Failed) {
            console.log(asyncResult.error.message);
            return;
          }

          console.log("Event handler added.");
        });
      }
    });
    ```

1. Save your changes.

## Get properties and run operations on selected messages

Now that you've registered an event handler, your add-in can now get properties or run operations on multiple selected messages. There are two ways to process selected messages. The use of each option depends on the properties and operations you need for your scenario.

- Call the [getSelectedItemsAsync](/javascript/api/outlook/office.mailbox#outlook-office-mailbox-getselecteditemsasync-member(1)) method to get the following properties.
  - Attachment boolean
  - Conversation ID
  - Internet message ID
  - Item ID
  - Item mode (`Read` or `Compose`)
  - Item type (`Message` is the only supported type at this time)
  - Subject line
- Call the [loadItemByIdAsync](/javascript/api/outlook/office.mailbox?view=outlook-js-preview&preserve-view=true#outlook-office-mailbox-loaditembyidasync-member(1)) method (preview) to get properties that aren't provided by `getSelectedItemsAsync` or to run operations on the selected messages. The `loadItemByIdAsync` method loads one selected message at a time using the message's Exchange Web Services (EWS) ID. To get the EWS IDs of the selected messages, we recommend calling `getSelectedItemsAsync`. After processing a selected message using `loadItemByIdAsync`, you must call the [unloadAsync](/javascript/api/outlook/office.loadedmessageread?view=outlook-js-preview&preserve-view=true#outlook-office-loadedmessageread-unloadasync-member(1)) method (preview) before calling `loadItemByIdAsync` on another selected message.

    > [!TIP]
    > Before you use the `loadItemByIdAsync` method, determine if you can already access the properties you need using `getSelectedItemsAsync`. If you can, you don't need to call `loadItemByIdAsync`.

The following example implements the `getSelectedItemsAsync` and `loadItemByIdAsync` methods to get the subject line and sender's email address from each selected message.

> [!NOTE]
> The `loadItemByIdAsync` method is currently in preview in classic Outlook on Windows. To preview this API, install Version 2405 (Build 17606.10000) or later. Then, join the [Microsoft 365 Insider program](https://insider.microsoft365.com/join/Windows) and select the **Beta Channel** option.

1. In **taskpane.js**, replace the existing `run` function with the following code.

    ```javascript
    export async function run() {
      // Clear the list of previously selected messages, if any.
      clearList(list);

      // Get the subject line and sender's email address of each selected message and log it to a list in the task pane.
      Office.context.mailbox.getSelectedItemsAsync((asyncResult) => {
        if (asyncResult.status === Office.AsyncResultStatus.Failed) {
          console.log(asyncResult.error.message);
          return;
        }

        const selectedItems = asyncResult.value;
        getItemInfo(selectedItems);
      });
    }

    // Gets the subject line and sender's email address of each selected message.
    async function getItemInfo(selectedItems) {
      for (const item of selectedItems) {
        addToList(item.subject);
        // The loadItemByIdAsync method is currently only available to preview in classic Outlook on Windows.
        if (Office.context.diagnostics.platform === Office.PlatformType.PC) {
          await getSenderEmailAddress(item);
        }
      }
    }

    // Gets the sender's email address of each selected message.
    async function getSenderEmailAddress(item) {
      const itemId = item.itemId;
      await new Promise((resolve) => {
        Office.context.mailbox.loadItemByIdAsync(itemId, (result) => {
          if (result.status === Office.AsyncResultStatus.Failed) {
            console.log(result.error.message);
            return;
          }

          const loadedItem = result.value;
          const sender = loadedItem.from.emailAddress;
          appendToListItem(sender);

          // Unload the current message before processing another selected message.
          loadedItem.unloadAsync((asyncResult) => {
            if (asyncResult.status === Office.AsyncResultStatus.Failed) {
              console.log(asyncResult.error.message);
              return;
            }

            resolve();
          });
        });
      });
    }

    // Clears the list in the task pane.
    function clearList(list) {
      while (list.firstChild) {
        list.removeChild(list.firstChild);
      }
    }

    // Adds an item to a list in the task pane.
    function addToList(item) {
      const listItem = document.createElement("li");
      listItem.textContent = item;
      list.appendChild(listItem);
    }

    // Appends data to the last item of the list in the task pane.
    function appendToListItem(data) {
      const listItem = list.lastChild;
      listItem.textContent += ` (${data})`;
    }
    ```

1. Save your changes.

## Try it out

1. From a terminal, run the following code in the root directory of your project. This starts the local web server and sideloads your add-in.

    ```command&nbsp;line
    npm start
    ```

    > [!TIP]
    > If your add-in doesn't automatically sideload, follow the instructions in [Sideload Outlook add-ins for testing](sideload-outlook-add-ins-for-testing.md#sideload-manually) to manually sideload it in Outlook.

1. In Outlook, ensure the Reading Pane is enabled. To enable the Reading Pane, see [Use and configure the Reading Pane to preview messages](https://support.microsoft.com/office/2fd687ed-7fc4-4ae3-8eab-9f9b8c6d53f0).

1. Navigate to your inbox and choose multiple messages by holding **Ctrl** while selecting messages.

1. Select **Show Taskpane**. The location of the add-in varies depending on your Outlook client. For guidance, see [Use add-ins in Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/office/1ee261f9-49bf-4ba6-b3e2-2ba7bcab64c8).

1. In the task pane, select **Get information**. A list of the selected messages' subject lines and sender email addresses is displayed in the task pane.

## Item multi-select behavior and limitations

Item multi-select only supports messages within an Exchange mailbox in both read and compose modes. An Outlook add-in only activates on multiple messages if the following conditions are met.

- The messages must be selected from one Exchange mailbox at a time. Non-Exchange mailboxes aren't supported.
- The messages must be selected from one mailbox folder at a time. An add-in doesn't activate on multiple messages if they're located in different folders, unless Conversations view is enabled. For more information, see [Multi-select in conversations](#multi-select-in-conversations).
- An add-in must implement a task pane in order to detect the `SelectedItemsChanged` event.
- The [Reading Pane](https://support.microsoft.com/office/2fd687ed-7fc4-4ae3-8eab-9f9b8c6d53f0) in Outlook must be enabled. An exception to this is if the item multi-select feature is enabled through the no item context feature in the manifest. To learn more, see [Activate your Outlook add-in without the Reading Pane enabled or a message selected](contextless.md).
- A maximum of 100 messages can be selected at a time.
- The `loadItemByIdAsync` method only processes one selected message at a time. Remember to call `unloadAsync` after `loadItemByIdAsync` finishes processing the message. This way, the add-in can load and process the next selected message.
- Typically, you can only run get operations on a selected message that's loaded using the `loadItemByIdAsync` method. However, managing the [categories](/javascript/api/outlook/office.categories) of a loaded message is an exception. You can add, get, and remove categories from a loaded message.
- The `loadItemByIdAsync` method is supported in task pane and function command add-ins. This method isn't supported in [event-based activation](autolaunch.md) add-ins.

> [!NOTE]
> Meeting invites and responses are considered messages, not appointments, and can therefore be included in a selection.

### Multi-select in conversations

Item multi-select supports [Conversations view](https://support.microsoft.com/office/0eeec76c-f59b-4834-98e6-05cfdfa9fb07) whether it's enabled on your mailbox or on specific folders. The following table describes expected behaviors when conversations are expanded or collapsed, when the conversation header is selected, and when conversation messages are located in a different folder from the one currently in view.

|Selection|Expanded conversation view|Collapsed conversation view|
|------|------|------|
|**Conversation header is selected**|If the conversation header is the only item selected, an add-in supporting multi-select doesn't activate. However, if other non-header messages are also selected, the add-in will only activate on those and not the selected header.|The behavior differs depending on the Outlook client.<br><br>**Outlook on Windows (classic) and on Mac**:<br>The newest message (that is, the first message in the conversation stack) is included in the message selection.<br><br>If the newest message in the conversation is located in another folder from the one currently in view, the subsequent message in the stack located in the current folder is included in the selection.<br><br>**Outlook on the web and new Outlook on Windows**:<br>All the messages in the conversation stack are selected. This includes messages in the conversation that are located in folders other than the one currently in view.|
|**Multiple selected messages in a conversation stack are located in the same folder as the one currently in view**|All chosen messages in the same conversation are included in the selection.|Not applicable. You must expand the conversation stack to select multiple messages from it.|
|**Multiple selected messages in a conversation stack are located in different folders from the one currently in view** |All chosen messages in the same conversation are included in the selection.|Not applicable. You must expand the conversation stack to select multiple messages from it.|

> [!NOTE]
> On all Outlook clients, you can't select multiple messages that belong to different conversations. If you expand a different conversation while another conversation is expanded, the view of the currently expanded conversation collapses and any selected messages are deselected. However, you can select multiple messages from the same expanded conversation and messages that aren't part of any conversation at the same time.

### Task pane pinning in multi-select add-ins

In Outlook on the web and in new Outlook on Windows, when the task pane of a multi-select add-in is opened, it's automatically pinned to the Outlook client. It remains pinned even when a user switches to a different mail item or selects the **pin** icon from the task pane. The task pane can only be closed by selecting the **Close** button from the task pane.

Conversely, in Outlook on Windows (classic) and on Mac, the task pane isn't automatically pinned and closes when a user switches to a different mail item.

## Next steps

Now that you've enabled your add-in to operate on multiple selected messages, you can extend your add-in's capabilities and further enhance the user experience.
