# Develop Outlook add-ins for the new Outlook on Windows

The new Outlook on Windows desktop client unifies the Windows and web codebases to create a more consistent Outlook experience for users and administrators. Its modern and simplified interface has added capabilities and aims to improve productivity, organization, and collaboration for users. More importantly, the new Outlook on Windows supports Outlook web add-ins, so that you can continue to extend Outlook's functionality.

## Impact on VSTO and COM add-ins

The new Outlook on Windows aims to unify the extensibility experience across all Outlook platforms. To provide a more reliable and stable add-in experience, VSTO and COM add-ins aren't supported in the new Outlook on Windows. To ensure your add-in continues to work in the new Outlook on Windows, you must migrate your VSTO or COM add-in to an Outlook web add-in. Migrating to an Outlook web add-in not only enables compatibility with the new Outlook on Windows, it also makes your solution available to users on other platforms, such as Outlook on Mac, on mobile, or on the web.

To help get you started on the migration process, review the following guidance.

- The differences in features and scenarios supported by VSTO and COM add-ins and Outlook web add-ins are being addressed. To determine whether your add-in scenario is fully supported in an Outlook web add-in, see [Supported scenarios in Outlook web add-ins](#supported-scenarios-in-outlook-web-add-ins).
- For guidance on how to transition your VSTO add-in to an Outlook web add-in, see [VSTO add-in developer's guide](../overview/learning-path-transition.md) and [Tutorial: Share code between both a VSTO Add-in and an Office Add-in with a shared code library](../tutorials/migrate-vsto-to-office-add-in-shared-code-library-tutorial.md).
- If you're new to Outlook web add-ins, try out the [Outlook quick start](../quickstarts/outlook-quickstart-yo.md) to build your first add-in.
- If you're an IT administrator and would like to learn more about how to transition to Outlook web add-ins in your organization, see [Transitioning add-ins from classic Outlook to the new Outlook for Windows](/microsoft-365-apps/outlook/get-started/migrate-com-to-web-addins#transitioning-add-ins-from-classic-outlook-to-the-new-outlook-for-windows). By default, when a user switches to new Outlook on Windows for the first time, they can choose to import their Outlook settings and install existing add-ins from classic Outlook on Windows. Because COM add-ins aren't supported in the new client, web add-in counterparts are installed instead. For more information, see [Install web add-in counterparts of existing COM add-ins in new Outlook for Windows](/microsoft-365-apps/outlook/get-started/install-web-add-ins).

> [!NOTE]
> VSTO and COM add-ins are still supported in classic Outlook on Windows.

### Supported scenarios in Outlook web add-ins

The development of the Outlook JavaScript API used by Outlook web add-ins is focused on closing the gap on scenarios that are only supported by VSTO and COM add-in solutions. This way, users who transition to the Outlook web add-in can continue to have a seamless experience.

The following table identifies key Outlook scenarios and their support status in a web add-in. This table will be updated as additional scenarios are supported. Periodically check this section as you plan to migrate your VSTO or COM add-in.

> [!TIP]
> As we continue to update the table of supported scenarios, if you want to view the recent changes made, select **Edit This Document** (**pencil icon**) from the top right corner of the article, then select **History**.

There are various possibilities for extending the Outlook functionality through add-ins. If your VSTO or COM add-in solution doesn't quite fit any of the scenarios in the table, [complete the survey to share your scenario](https://aka.ms/DevNewOutlook).

## Support for classic Outlook on Windows

Classic Outlook on Windows with a Microsoft 365 subscription or a retail perpetual version of Office 2016 or later will continue to support the development of new and existing Outlook web add-ins. Additionally, it will continue to receive releases of the latest Outlook add-in features.

## Test your add-in in the new Outlook on Windows

Test your Outlook web add-in in the new Outlook on Windows today! To switch to the new Outlook on Windows, you must meet the following requirements.

- Have a Microsoft 365 work or school account connected to Exchange Online. The new client doesn't currently support on-premises, hybrid, or sovereign Exchange accounts.

    > [!NOTE]
    > While you can add non-Microsoft mail accounts, such as Gmail, to the new Outlook on Windows, you can only use Outlook add-ins with a Microsoft account.

- Have a minimum OS installation of Windows 10 Version 1809 (Build 17763).

To help you install and set up the Outlook desktop client, see [Getting started with the new Outlook for Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/office/656bb8d9-5a60-49b2-a98b-ba7822bc7627).

For guidance on how to sideload your add-in, see [Sideload Outlook add-ins for testing](sideload-outlook-add-ins-for-testing.md).

> [!TIP]
> If you're moving from the classic Outlook client on Windows to the new Outlook client, note that the location of add-ins is different. While add-ins are accessed from the ribbon or app bar in the classic Outlook client, access to add-ins in the new Outlook client depends on whether you're reading or composing a mail item. To learn more, see [Use add-ins in Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/office/1ee261f9-49bf-4ba6-b3e2-2ba7bcab64c8).

## Debug your add-in

To debug an add-in installed in the new Outlook on Windows desktop client, perform the following:

1. Close the new Outlook on Windows client if you already have it open.
1. Then, in a command prompt, run the following command to open the new Outlook on Windows client and an instance of the Microsoft Edge DevTools.

    ```command&nbsp;line
    olk.exe --devtools
    ```

    > [!TIP]
    > After running the command, the DevTools window stays open, so that you can debug an add-in's task pane as you open and close it. If you close the DevTools window, you must close your Outlook client first before running `olk.exe --devtools` again.

1. [Sideload the add-in to Outlook on the web](sideload-outlook-add-ins-for-testing.md).
1. Use Microsoft Edge DevTools to debug your add-in.

## Development experience feedback

As you test your Outlook web add-in in the new Outlook on Windows, share feedback on your experience with the developer community through [GitHub](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js/issues/new/choose).
