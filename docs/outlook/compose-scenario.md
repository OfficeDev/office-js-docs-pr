# Create Outlook add-ins for compose forms

You can create compose add-ins, which are Outlook add-ins activated in compose forms. In contrast with read add-ins (Outlook add-ins that are activated in read mode when a user is viewing a message or appointment), compose add-ins are available in the following user scenarios.

- Composing a new message, meeting request, or appointment in a compose form.

- Viewing or editing an existing appointment, or meeting item in which the user is the organizer.

- Composing an inline response message or replying to a message in a separate compose form.

- Editing a response (**Accept**, **Tentative**, or **Decline**) to a meeting request or meeting item.

- Proposing a new time for a meeting item.

- Forwarding or replying to a meeting request or meeting item.

In each of these scenarios, any add-in command buttons defined by the add-in are shown in compose form.

## Types of add-ins available in compose mode

Compose add-ins are implemented as [add-in commands](../design/add-in-commands.md). To activate add-ins for composing email or meeting responses, add-ins include a [MessageComposeCommandSurface extension point element](/javascript/api/manifest/extensionpoint#messagecomposecommandsurface) in the manifest. To activate add-ins for composing or editing appointments or meetings where the user is the organizer, add-ins include a [AppointmentOrganizerCommandSurface extension point element](/javascript/api/manifest/extensionpoint#appointmentorganizercommandsurface). For more information on manifests, see [Office add-in manifests](../develop/add-in-manifests.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Add-ins developed for servers or clients that don't support add-in commands use [activation rules](activation-rules.md) in a [Rule](/javascript/api/manifest/rule) element contained in the [OfficeApp](/javascript/api/manifest/officeapp) element. Unless the add-in is being specifically developed for older clients and servers, new add-ins should use add-in commands.
>
> Add-ins that use activation rules aren't supported in an add-in that uses a [Unified manifest for Microsoft 365](../develop/unified-manifest-overview.md).
