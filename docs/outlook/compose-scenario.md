# Create Outlook add-ins for compose forms

Starting with version 1.1 of the schema for Office Add-ins manifests and v1.1 of Office.js, you can create compose add-ins, which are Outlook add-ins activated in compose forms. In contrast with read add-ins (Outlook add-ins that are activated in read mode when a user is viewing a message or appointment), compose add-ins are available in the following user scenarios:

- Composing a new message, meeting request, or appointment in a compose form.

- Viewing or editing an existing appointment, or meeting item in which the user is the organizer.
    
   > [!NOTE]
   > If the user is on the RTM release of Outlook 2013 and Exchange 2013 and is viewing a meeting item organized by the user, the user can find read add-ins available. Starting in the Office 2013 SP1 release, there's a change such that in the same scenario, only compose add-ins can activate and be available.

- Composing an inline response message or replying to a message in a separate compose form.

- Editing a response (**Accept**, **Tentative**, or **Decline**) to a meeting request or meeting item.

- Proposing a new time for a meeting item.

- Forwarding or replying to a meeting request or meeting item.

In each of these compose scenarios, any add-in command buttons defined by the add-in are shown. For older add-ins that do not implement add-in commands, users can choose **Office Add-ins** in the ribbon to open the add-in selection pane, and then choose and start a compose add-in. The following figure shows add-in commands in a compose form.

The following figure shows the add-in selection pane consisting of two compose add-ins that do not implement add-in commands, activated when the user is composing an inline reply in Outlook.

## Types of add-ins available in compose mode

Compose add-ins are implemented as [Add-in commands for Outlook](add-in-commands-for-outlook.md). To activate add-ins for composing email or meeting responses, add-ins include a [MessageComposeCommandSurface extension point element](../reference/manifest/extensionpoint.md#messagecomposecommandsurface) in the manifest. To activate add-ins for composing or editing appointments or meetings where the user is the organizer, add-ins include a [AppointmentOrganizerCommandSurface extension point element](../reference/manifest/extensionpoint.md#appointmentorganizercommandsurface).

> [!NOTE]
> Add-ins developed for servers or clients that do not support add-in commands use [activation rules](activation-rules.md) in a [Rule](../reference/manifest/rule.md) element contained in the [OfficeApp](../reference/manifest/officeapp.md) element. Unless the add-in is being specifically developed for older clients and servers, new add-ins should use add-in commands.
