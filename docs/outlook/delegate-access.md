# Enable delegate access scenarios in an Outlook add-in

A mailbox owner can use the delegate access feature to [allow someone else to manage their mail and calendar](https://support.office.com/article/allow-someone-else-to-manage-your-mail-and-calendar-41c40c04-3bd1-4d22-963a-28eafec25926). This article specifies which delegate permissions the Office JavaScript API supports and describes how to enable delegate access scenarios in your Outlook add-in.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Delegate access is not currently available in Outlook on Mac, Android, and iOS. Also, this feature is not currently available with [group shared mailboxes](/microsoft-365/admin/create-groups/compare-groups?view=o365-worldwide#shared-mailboxes) in Outlook on the web. This functionality may be made available in the future.
>
> Support for this feature was introduced in requirement set 1.8. See [clients and platforms](../reference/requirement-sets/outlook-api-requirement-sets.md#requirement-sets-supported-by-exchange-servers-and-outlook-clients) that support this requirement set.

## Supported permissions for delegate access

The following table describes the delegate permissions that the Office JavaScript API supports.

|Permission|Value|Description|
|---|---:|---|
|Read|1 (000001)|Can read items.|
|Write|2 (000010)|Can create items.|
|DeleteOwn|4 (000100)|Can delete only the items they created.|
|DeleteAll|8 (001000)|Can delete any items.|
|EditOwn|16 (010000)|Can edit only the items they created.|
|EditAll|32 (100000)|Can edit any items.|

> [!NOTE]
> Currently the API supports getting existing delegate permissions, but not setting delegate permissions.

The [DelegatePermissions](/javascript/api/outlook/office.mailboxenums.delegatepermissions) object is implemented using a bitmask to indicate the delegate's permissions. Each position in the bitmask represents a particular permission and if it's set to `1` then the delegate has the respective permission. For example, if the second bit from the right is `1`, then the delegate has **Write** permission. You can see an example of how to check for a specific permission in the [Perform an operation as delegate](#perform-an-operation-as-delegate) section later in this article.

## Sync across mailbox clients

A delegate's updates to the owner's mailbox are usually synced across mailboxes immediately.

However, if REST or Exchange Web Services (EWS) operations were used to set an extended property on an item, such changes could take a few hours to sync. We recommend you instead use the [CustomProperties](/javascript/api/outlook/office.customproperties) object and related APIs to avoid such a delay. To learn more, see the [custom properties section](metadata-for-an-outlook-add-in.md#custom-data-per-item-in-a-mailbox-custom-properties) of the "Get and set metadata in an Outlook add-in" article.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In a delegate scenario, you can't use EWS with the tokens currently provided by office.js API.

## Configure the manifest

To enable delegate access scenarios in your add-in, you must set the [SupportsSharedFolders](../reference/manifest/supportssharedfolders.md) element to `true` in the manifest under the parent element `DesktopFormFactor`. At present, other form factors are not supported.

To support REST calls from a delegate, set the [Permissions](../reference/manifest/permissions.md) node in the manifest to `ReadWriteMailbox`.

The following example shows the `SupportsSharedFolders` element set to `true` in a section of the manifest.

```XML
...
<VersionOverrides xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/mailappversionoverrides" xsi:type="VersionOverridesV1_0">
  <VersionOverrides xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/mailappversionoverrides/1.1" xsi:type="VersionOverridesV1_1">
    ...
    <Hosts>
      <Host xsi:type="MailHost">
        <DesktopFormFactor>
          <SupportsSharedFolders>true</SupportsSharedFolders>
          <FunctionFile resid="residDesktopFuncUrl" />
          <ExtensionPoint xsi:type="MessageReadCommandSurface">
            <!-- configure selected extension point -->
          </ExtensionPoint>

          <!-- You can define more than one ExtensionPoint element as needed -->

        </DesktopFormFactor>
      </Host>
    </Hosts>
    ...
  </VersionOverrides>
</VersionOverrides>
...
```

## Perform an operation as delegate

You can get an item's shared properties in Compose or Read mode by calling the [item.getSharedPropertiesAsync](../reference/objectmodel/preview-requirement-set/office.context.mailbox.item.md#methods) method. This returns a [SharedProperties](/javascript/api/outlook/office.sharedproperties) object that currently provides the delegate's permissions, the owner's email address, the REST API's base URL, and the target mailbox.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In a delegate scenario, your add-in can use REST but not EWS, and the add-in's permission must be set to `ReadWriteMailbox` to enable REST access to the owner's mailbox.

The following example shows how to get the shared properties of a message or appointment, check if the delegate has **Write** permission, and make a REST call.

```js
function performOperation() {
  Office.context.mailbox.getCallbackTokenAsync({
      isRest: true
    },
    function (asyncResult) {
      if (asyncResult.status === Office.AsyncResultStatus.Succeeded && asyncResult.value !== "") {
        Office.context.mailbox.item.getSharedPropertiesAsync({
            // Pass auth token along.
            asyncContext: asyncResult.value
          },
          function (asyncResult1) {
            let sharedProperties = asyncResult1.value;
            let delegatePermissions = sharedProperties.delegatePermissions;

            // Determine if user can do the expected operation.
            // E.g., do they have Write permission?
            if ((delegatePermissions & Office.MailboxEnums.DelegatePermissions.Write) != 0) {
              // Construct REST URL for your operation.
              // Update <version> placeholder with actual Outlook REST API version e.g. "v2.0".
              // Update <operation> placeholder with actual operation.
              let rest_url = sharedProperties.targetRestUrl + "/<version>/users/" + sharedProperties.targetMailbox + "/<operation>";
  
              $.ajax({
                  url: rest_url,
                  dataType: 'json',
                  headers:
                  {
                    "Authorization": "Bearer " + asyncResult1.asyncContext
                  }
                }
              ).done(
                function (response) {
                  console.log("success");
                }
              ).fail(
                function (error) {
                  console.log("error message");
                }
              );
            }
          }
        );
      }
    }
  );
}
```

> [!TIP]
> As a delegate, you can use REST to [get the content of an Outlook message attached to an Outlook item or group post](/graph/outlook-get-mime-message#get-mime-content-of-an-outlook-message-attached-to-an-outlook-item-or-group-post).
