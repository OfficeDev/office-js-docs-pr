# Manage an item's attachments in a compose form in Outlook

The Office JavaScript API provides several APIs you can use to manage an item's attachments when the user is composing.

## Attach a file or Outlook item

You can attach a file or Outlook item to a compose form by using the method that's appropriate for the type of attachment.

- [addFileAttachmentAsync](../reference/objectmodel/preview-requirement-set/office.context.mailbox.item.md#methods): Attach a file
- [addFileAttachmentFromBase64Async](../reference/objectmodel/preview-requirement-set/office.context.mailbox.item.md#methods): Attach a file using its base64 string
- [addItemAttachmentAsync](../reference/objectmodel/preview-requirement-set/office.context.mailbox.item.md#methods): Attach an Outlook item

These are asynchronous methods, which means execution can go on without waiting for the action to complete. Depending on the original location and size of the attachment being added, the asynchronous call may take a while to complete.

If there are tasks that depend on the action to complete, you should carry out those tasks in a callback method. This callback method is optional and is invoked when the attachment upload has completed. The callback method takes an [AsyncResult](/javascript/api/office/office.asyncresult) object as an output parameter that provides any status, error, and returned value from adding the attachment. If the callback requires any extra parameters, you can specify them in the optional `options.asyncContext` parameter. `options.asyncContext` can be of any type that your callback method expects.

For example, you can define `options.asyncContext` as a JSON object that contains one or more key-value pairs. You can find more examples about passing optional parameters to asynchronous methods in the Office Add-ins platform in [Asynchronous programming in Office Add-ins](../develop/asynchronous-programming-in-office-add-ins.md#passing-optional-parameters-to-asynchronous-methods). The following example shows how to use the `asyncContext` parameter to pass 2 arguments to a callback method.

```js
var options = { asyncContext: { var1: 1, var2: 2}};

Office.context.mailbox.item.addFileAttachmentAsync('https://contoso.com/rtm/icon.png', 'icon.png', options, callback);
```

You can check for success or error of an asynchronous method call in the callback method using the `status` and `error` properties of the `AsyncResult` object. If the attaching completes successfully, you can use the `AsyncResult.value` property to get the attachment ID. The attachment ID is an integer which you can subsequently use to remove the attachment.

> [!NOTE]
> The attachment ID is valid only within the same session and isn't guaranteed to map to the same attachment across sessions. Examples of when a session is over include when the user closes the add-in, or if the user starts composing in an inline form and subsequently pops out the inline form to continue in a separate window.

### Attach a file

You can attach a file to a message or appointment in a compose form by using the `addFileAttachmentAsync` method and specifying the URI of the file. You can also use the `addFileAttachmentFromBase64Async` method but specify the base64 string as input. If the file is protected, you can include an appropriate identity or authentication token as a URI query string parameter. Exchange will make a call to the URI to get the attachment, and the web service which protects the file will need to use the token as a means of authentication.

The following JavaScript example is a compose add-in that attaches a file, picture.png, from a web server to the message or appointment being composed. The callback method takes `asyncResult` as a parameter, checks for the result status, and gets the attachment ID if the method succeeds.

```js
Office.initialize = function () {
    // Checks for the DOM to load using the jQuery ready function.
    $(document).ready(function () {
        // After the DOM is loaded, app-specific code can run.
        // Add the specified file attachment to the item
        // being composed.
        // When the attachment finishes uploading, the
        // callback method is invoked and gets the attachment ID.
        // You can optionally pass any object that you would
        // access in the callback method as an argument to
        // the asyncContext parameter.
        Office.context.mailbox.item.addFileAttachmentAsync(
            `https://webserver/picture.png`,
            'picture.png',
            { asyncContext: null },
            function (asyncResult) {
                if (asyncResult.status === Office.AsyncResultStatus.Failed){
                    write(asyncResult.error.message);
                } else {
                    // Get the ID of the attached file.
                    var attachmentID = asyncResult.value;
                    write('ID of added attachment: ' + attachmentID);
                }
            });
    });
}

// Writes to a div with id='message' on the page.
function write(message){
    document.getElementById('message').innerText += message;
}
```

### Attach an Outlook item

You can attach an Outlook item (for example, email, calendar, or contact item) to a message or appointment in a compose form by specifying the Exchange Web Services (EWS) ID of the item and using the `addItemAttachmentAsync` method. You can get the EWS ID of an email, calendar, contact, or task item in the user's mailbox by using the [mailbox.makeEwsRequestAsync](../reference/objectmodel/preview-requirement-set/office.context.mailbox.md#methods) method and accessing the EWS operation [FindItem](/exchange/client-developer/web-service-reference/finditem-operation). The [item.itemId](../reference/objectmodel/preview-requirement-set/office.context.mailbox.item.md#properties) property also provides the EWS ID of an existing item in a read form.

The following JavaScript function, `addItemAttachment`, extends the first example above, and adds an item as an attachment to the email or appointment that is being composed. The function takes as an argument the EWS ID of the item that is to be attached. If attaching succeeds, it gets the attachment ID for further processing, including removing that attachment in the same session.

```js
// Adds the specified item as an attachment to the composed item.
// ID is the EWS ID of the item to be attached.
function addItemAttachment(itemId) {
    // When the attachment finishes uploading, the
    // callback method is invoked. Here, the callback
    // method uses only asyncResult as a parameter,
    // and if the attaching succeeds, gets the attachment ID.
    // You can optionally pass any other object you wish to
    // access in the callback method as an argument to
    // the asyncContext parameter.
    Office.context.mailbox.item.addItemAttachmentAsync(
        itemId,
        'Welcome email',
        { asyncContext: null },
        function (asyncResult) {
            if (asyncResult.status === Office.AsyncResultStatus.Failed){
                write(asyncResult.error.message);
            } else {
                var attachmentID = asyncResult.value;
                write('ID of added attachment: ' + attachmentID);
            }
        });
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can use a compose add-in to attach an instance of a recurring appointment in Outlook on the web or on mobile devices. However, in a supporting Outlook desktop client, attempting to attach an instance would result in attaching the recurring series (the parent appointment).

## Get attachments

APIs to get attachments in compose mode are available from [requirement set 1.8](../reference/objectmodel/requirement-set-1.8/outlook-requirement-set-1.8.md).

- [getAttachmentsAsync](../reference/objectmodel/preview-requirement-set/office.context.mailbox.item.md#methods)
- [getAttachmentContentAsync](../reference/objectmodel/preview-requirement-set/office.context.mailbox.item.md#methods)

You can use the [getAttachmentsAsync](../reference/objectmodel/preview-requirement-set/office.context.mailbox.item.md#methods) method to get the attachments of the message or appointment being composed.

To get an attachment's content, you can use the [getAttachmentContentAsync](../reference/objectmodel/preview-requirement-set/office.context.mailbox.item.md#methods) method. The supported formats are listed in the [AttachmentContentFormat](/javascript/api/outlook/office.mailboxenums.attachmentcontentformat) enum.

You should provide a callback method to check for the status and any error by using the `AsyncResult` output parameter object. You can also pass any additional parameters to the callback method by using the optional `asyncContext` parameter.

The following JavaScript example gets the attachments and allows you to set up distinct handling for each supported attachment format.

```js
var item = Office.context.mailbox.item;
var options = {asyncContext: {currentItem: item}};
item.getAttachmentsAsync(options, callback);

function callback(result) {
  if (result.value.length > 0) {
    for (i = 0 ; i < result.value.length ; i++) {
      result.asyncContext.currentItem.getAttachmentContentAsync(result.value[i].id, handleAttachmentsCallback);
    }
  }
}

function handleAttachmentsCallback(result) {
  // Parse string to be a url, an .eml file, a base64-encoded string, or an .icalendar file.
  switch (result.value.format) {
    case Office.MailboxEnums.AttachmentContentFormat.Base64:
      // Handle file attachment.
      break;
    case Office.MailboxEnums.AttachmentContentFormat.Eml:
      // Handle email item attachment.
      break;
    case Office.MailboxEnums.AttachmentContentFormat.ICalendar:
      // Handle .icalender attachment.
      break;
    case Office.MailboxEnums.AttachmentContentFormat.Url:
      // Handle cloud attachment.
      break;
    default:
      // Handle attachment formats that are not supported.
  }
}
```

## Remove an attachment

You can remove a file or item attachment from a message or appointment item in a compose form by specifying the corresponding attachment ID when using the [removeAttachmentAsync](../reference/objectmodel/preview-requirement-set/office.context.mailbox.item.md#methods) method.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're using requirement set 1.7 or earlier, you should only remove attachments that the same add-in has added in the same session.

Similar to the `addFileAttachmentAsync`, `addItemAttachmentAsync`, and `getAttachmentsAsync` methods, `removeAttachmentAsync` is an asynchronous method. You should provide a callback method to check for the status and any error by using the `AsyncResult` output parameter object. You can also pass any additional parameters to the callback method by using the optional `asyncContext` parameter.

The following JavaScript function, `removeAttachment`, continues to extend the examples above, and removes the specified attachment from the email or appointment that is being composed. The function takes as an argument the ID of the attachment to be removed. You can obtain the ID of an attachment after a successful `addFileAttachmentAsync`, `addFileAttachmentFromBase64Async`, or `addItemAttachmentAsync` method call, and use it in a subsequent `removeAttachmentAsync` method call. You can also call `getAttachmentsAsync` (introduced in requirement set 1.8) to get the attachments and their IDs for that add-in session.

```js
// Removes the specified attachment from the composed item.
function removeAttachment(attachmentId) {
    // When the attachment is removed, the callback method is invoked.
    // Here, the callback method uses an asyncResult parameter and
    // gets the ID of the removed attachment if the removal succeeds.
    // You can optionally pass any object you wish to access in the
    // callback method as an argument to the asyncContext parameter.
    Office.context.mailbox.item.removeAttachmentAsync(
        attachmentId,
        { asyncContext: null },
        function (asyncResult) {
            if (asyncResult.status === Office.AsyncResultStatus.Failed) {
                write(asyncResult.error.message);
            } else {
                write('Removed attachment with the ID: ' + asyncResult.value);
            }
        });
}
```
