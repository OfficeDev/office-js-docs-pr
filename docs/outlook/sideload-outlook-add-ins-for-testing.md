# Sideload Outlook add-ins for testing

Sideload your Outlook add-in for testing without having to first put it in an add-in catalog.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your Outlook add-in supports mobile, sideload the manifest using the instructions in this article for your Outlook client on the web, Windows, or Mac, then follow the guidance in the **Testing your add-ins on mobile** section of the [Add-ins for Outlook Mobile](outlook-mobile-addins.md#testing-your-add-ins-on-mobile) article.

## Sideload automatically

If you created your Outlook add-in using the [Yeoman generator for Office Add-ins](../develop/yeoman-generator-overview.md), sideloading is best done through the command line on Windows. This will take advantage of our tooling and sideload across all of your supported devices in one command.

1. On Windows, open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of your Yeoman generated add-in project. Run the command `npm start`.

1. Your Outlook add-in will automatically sideload to Outlook on your desktop computer. You'll see a dialog appear, stating there is an attempt to sideload the add-in, listing the name and the location of the manifest file. Select **OK**, which will register the manifest.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If the manifest contains an error or the path to the manifest is invalid, you'll receive an error message.

1. If your manifest contains no errors and the path is valid, your add-in will now be sideloaded and available on both your desktop and in Outlook on the web. It will also be installed across all your supported devices.

## Sideload manually

Though we strongly recommend sideloading automatically through the command line as covered in the previous section, you can also manually sideload an Outlook add-in based on the Outlook client.

### Outlook on the web

The process for sideloading an add-in in Outlook on the web depends upon whether you are using the new or classic version.

- If your mailbox toolbar looks like the following image, see [Sideload an add-in in the new Outlook on the web](#new-outlook-on-the-web).

To navigate to the **My Add-ins** dialog box for your Outlook client, use the last steps listed for [manual sideloading](#sideload-manually) in the previous sections of this article.

To remove a sideloaded add-in from Outlook, use the steps previously described in this article to find the add-in in the **Custom add-ins** section of the dialog box that lists your installed add-ins.
