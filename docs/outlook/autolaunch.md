# Configure your Outlook add-in for event-based activation (preview)

Without the event-based activation feature, a user has to explicitly launch an add-in to complete their tasks. This feature enables your add-in to run tasks based on certain events, particularly for operations that apply to every item. You can also integrate with the task pane and UI-less functionality. At present, the following events are supported.

- `OnNewMessageCompose`: On composing a new message (includes reply, reply all, and forward)
- `OnNewAppointmentOrganizer`: On creating a new appointment

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > This feature does **not** activate on editing an item, for example, a draft or an existing appointment.

By the end of this walkthrough, you'll have an add-in that runs whenever a new message is created.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is only supported for [preview](../reference/objectmodel/preview-requirement-set/outlook-requirement-set-preview.md) in Outlook on the web and Windows with a Microsoft 365 subscription. See [How to preview the event-based activation feature](#how-to-preview-the-event-based-activation-feature) in this article for more details.
>
> Because preview features are subject to change without notice, they shouldn't be used in production add-ins.

## How to preview the event-based activation feature

We invite you to try out the event-based activation feature! Let us know your scenarios and how we can improve by giving us feedback through GitHub (see the **Feedback** section at the end of this page).

To preview this feature:

- For Outlook on the web:
  - [Configure targeted release on your Microsoft 365 tenant](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/release-options-in-office-365?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true#set-up-the-release-option-in-the-admin-center).
  - Reference the **beta** library on the CDN (https://appsforoffice.microsoft.com/lib/beta/hosted/office.js). The [type definition file](https://appsforoffice.microsoft.com/lib/beta/hosted/office.d.ts) for TypeScript compilation and IntelliSense is found at the CDN and [DefinitelyTyped](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/master/types/office-js-preview/index.d.ts). You can install these types with `npm install --save-dev @types/office-js-preview`.
- For Outlook on Windows: The minimum required build is 16.0.13729.20000. Join the [Office Insider program](https://insider.office.com) for access to Office beta builds.

## Set up your environment

Complete the [Outlook quick start](../quickstarts/outlook-quickstart.md?tabs=yeomangenerator) which creates an add-in project with the Yeoman generator for Office Add-ins.

## Configure the manifest

To enable event-based activation of your add-in, you must configure the [Runtimes](../reference/manifest/runtimes.md) element and [LaunchEvent](../reference/manifest/extensionpoint.md#launchevent-preview) extension point in the `VersionOverridesV1_1` node of the manifest. For now, `DesktopFormFactor` is the only supported form factor.

1. In your code editor, open the quick start project.

1. Open the **manifest.xml** file located at the root of your project.

1. Select the entire `<VersionOverrides>` node (including open and close tags) and replace it with the following XML.

```XML
<VersionOverrides xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/mailappversionoverrides" xsi:type="VersionOverridesV1_0">

Outlook on Windows uses a JavaScript file, while Outlook on the web uses an HTML file that can reference the same JavaScript file. You must provide references to both these files in the `Resources` node of the manifest as the Outlook platform ultimately determines whether to use HTML or JavaScript based on the Outlook client. As such, to configure event handling, provide the location of the HTML in the `Runtime` element, then in its `Override` child element provide the location of the JavaScript file inlined or referenced by the HTML.

> [!TIP]
> To learn more about manifests for Outlook add-ins, see [Outlook add-in manifests](manifests.md).

## Implement event handling

You have to implement handling for your selected events.

In this scenario, you'll add handling for composing new items.

1. From the same quick start project, open the file **./src/commands/commands.js** in your code editor.

1. After the `action` function, insert the following JavaScript functions.

    ```js
    function onMessageComposeHandler(event) {
      setSubject(event);
    }
    function onAppointmentComposeHandler(event) {
      setSubject(event);
    }
    function setSubject(event) {
      Office.context.mailbox.item.subject.setAsync(
        "Set by an event-based add-in!",
        {
          "asyncContext" : event
        },
        function (asyncResult) {
          // Handle success or error.
          if (asyncResult.status !== Office.AsyncResultStatus.Succeeded) {
            console.error("Failed to set subject: " + JSON.stringify(asyncResult.error));
          }
    
          // Call event.completed() after all work is done.
          asyncResult.asyncContext.completed();
        });
    }
    ```

1. For the functions to work in **Outlook on the web** with this project generated by the Yeoman generator for Office Add-ins, add the following statements at the end of the file.

    ```js
    g.onMessageComposeHandler = onMessageComposeHandler;
    g.onAppointmentComposeHandler = onAppointmentComposeHandler;
    ```

1. For the functions to work in **Outlook on Windows**, add the following JavaScript code at the end of the file.

    ```js
    if (Office.actions) {
      // 1st parameter: FunctionName of LaunchEvent in the manifest; 2nd parameter: Its implementation in this .js file.
      Office.actions.associate("onMessageComposeHandler", onMessageComposeHandler);
      Office.actions.associate("onAppointmentComposeHandler", onAppointmentComposeHandler);
    }
    ```

    **Note**: Checking for `Office.actions` ensures that Outlook on the web ignores these statements.

## Try it out

1. Run the following command in the root directory of your project. When you run this command, the local web server will start (if it's not already running).

    ```command&nbsp;line
    npm run dev-server
    ```

1. Follow the instructions in [Sideload Outlook add-ins for testing](sideload-outlook-add-ins-for-testing.md) to sideload the add-in in Outlook.

1. In Outlook on the web, create a new message.

    ![Screenshot of a message window in Outlook on the web with the subject set on compose](../images/outlook-web-autolaunch-1.png)

1. In Outlook on Windows, create a new message.

## Event-based activation behavior and limitations

Add-ins that activate based on events are expected to be short-running, lightweight, and as non-invasive as possible. To signal that your add-in has completed processing the launch event, we recommend you have your add-in call the `event.completed` method. If that call is not made, the add-in will time out within approximately 300 seconds, the maximum length of time allowed for running event-based add-ins. The add-in also ends when the user closes the compose window.

If the user has multiple add-ins that subscribed to the same event, the Outlook platform launches the add-ins in no particular order. Currently, only five event-based add-ins can be actively running. Any additional add-ins are pushed to a queue then run as previously active add-ins are completed or deactivated.

The user can switch or navigate away from the current mail item where the add-in started running. The add-in that was launched will finish its operation in the background.

Some Office.js APIs that change or alter the UI are not allowed from event-based add-ins. The following are the blocked APIs:

- Under `Office.context.mailbox`:
  - `displayAppointmentForm`
  - `displayMessageForm`
  - `displayNewAppointmentForm`
  - `displayNewMessageForm`
- Under `Office.context.ui`:
  - `displayDialogAsync`
  - `messageParent`
- Under `Office.context.auth`:
  - `getAccessToken`
  - `getAccessTokenAsync`
