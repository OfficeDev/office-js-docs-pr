# Configure your Outlook add-in for event-based activation

The event-based activation feature lets a user use your add-in to complete their tasks without explicitly launching the add-in. Your add-in will run tasks when certain events occur, such as automatically update a mail item's attachments when the recipients change or check for a particular attachment before a mail item is sent. You can also integrate event-based activation with the task pane and function commands.

> [!NOTE]
> Support for this feature was introduced in [requirement set 1.10](/javascript/api/requirement-sets/outlook/requirement-set-1.10/outlook-requirement-set-1.10), with additional events now available in subsequent requirement sets. For details about an event's minimum requirement set and the clients and platforms that support it, see [Supported events](#supported-events) and [Requirement sets supported by Exchange servers and Outlook clients](/javascript/api/requirement-sets/outlook/outlook-api-requirement-sets#requirement-sets-supported-by-exchange-servers-and-outlook-clients).

> To learn how to implement an event-based add-in that runs in Outlook on mobile devices, see [Implement event-based activation in Outlook mobile add-ins](mobile-event-based.md).

## Supported events

The following table lists events that are currently available and the supported clients for each event. When an event is raised, the handler receives an `event` object which may include details specific to the type of event. The **Description** column includes a link to the related object where applicable.

> [!NOTE]
> <sup>1</sup> Event-based add-ins in Outlook on Windows require a minimum of Windows 10 Version 1903 (Build 18362) or Windows Server 2019 Version 1903 to run.
>
> <sup>2</sup> Outlook on mobile supports APIs up to Mailbox requirement set 1.5. However, support is now enabled for additional APIs and features introduced in later requirement sets, such as the `OnNewMessageCompose` event. To learn more, see [Implement event-based activation in Outlook mobile add-ins](mobile-event-based.md).

## Troubleshooting guide

As you develop your event-based add-in, you may need to troubleshoot issues, such as your add-in not loading or the event not occurring. If you run into development issues, refer to the next four sections for troubleshooting guidance.

### Review event-based activation prerequisites

- Verify that the add-in is installed on a supported Outlook client. Some Outlook clients only support certain events. For example, Outlook on Android only supports the `OnNewMessageCompose` event. For more information, see [Supported events](#supported-events).
- Verify that your Outlook client supports the minimum requirement set needed to handle the event. Event-based activation was introduced in [requirement set 1.10](/javascript/api/requirement-sets/outlook/requirement-set-1.10/outlook-requirement-set-1.10), with additional events now supported in subsequent requirements sets. For more information, see [Supported events](#supported-events) and [Requirement sets supported by Exchange servers and Outlook clients](/javascript/api/requirement-sets/outlook/outlook-api-requirement-sets#requirement-sets-supported-by-exchange-servers-and-outlook-clients). If you're developing an add-in that uses the [Smart Alerts](onmessagesend-onappointmentsend-events.md) feature, see the [Supported clients and platform section](onmessagesend-onappointmentsend-events.md#supported-clients-and-platforms).
- Review the expected behavior and limitations of the [event-based activation](#event-based-activation-behavior-and-limitations) and [Smart Alerts](onmessagesend-onappointmentsend-events.md#smart-alerts-feature-behavior-and-scenarios) features.

### Check manifest and JavaScript requirements

- Ensure that the following conditions are met in your add-in's manifest.
  - Verify that your add-in's source file location URL is publicly available and isn't blocked by a firewall. This URL is specified in your manifest's [SourceLocation element](/javascript/api/manifest/sourcelocation).
  - Verify that the **\<Runtimes\>** element (XML manifest) or "code" object (unified manifest (preview)) correctly references the HTML or JavaScript file containing the event handlers. Outlook on Windows uses the JavaScript file during runtime, while Outlook on the web and on new Mac UI use the HTML file. For an example of how this is configured in the manifest, see the "Configure the manifest" section of [Automatically set the subject of a new message or appointment](on-new-compose-events-walkthrough.md#configure-the-manifest).
  
    For Outlook on Windows, you must bundle all your event-handling JavaScript code into this JavaScript file referenced in the manifest. Note that a large JavaScript bundle may cause issues with the performance of your add-in. We recommend preprocessing heavy operations, so that they're not included in your event-handling code.
- Verify that your event-handling JavaScript file referenced by the Outlook client on Windows calls `Office.actions.associate`. This ensures that the event handler name specified in the manifest is mapped to its JavaScript counterpart.

  > [!TIP]
  > If your event-based add-in has only one JavaScript file referenced by Outlook on the web, Windows, and Mac, it's recommended to check on which platform the add-in is running to determine when to call `Office.actions.associate`, as shown in the following code.
  >
  > ```js
  > if (Office.context.platform === Office.PlatformType.PC || Office.context.platform == null) {
  >   Office.actions.associate("onNewMessageComposeHandler", onNewMessageComposeHandler);
  >   Office.actions.associate("onNewAppointmentComposeHandler", onNewAppointmentComposeHandler);
  > }
  > ```

- The JavaScript code of event-based add-ins that run in Outlook on Windows only supports [ECMAScript 2016](https://262.ecma-international.org/7.0/) and earlier specifications. Some examples of programming syntax to avoid are as follows.
  - Avoid using `async` and `await` statements in your code. Including these in your JavaScript code will cause the add-in to time out.
  - Avoid using the [conditional (ternary) operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator) as it will prevent your add-in from loading.
  
  If your add-in has only one JavaScript file referenced by Outlook on the web, Windows, and Mac, you must limit your code to ECMAScript 2016 to ensure that your add-in runs in Outlook on Windows. However, if you have a separate JavaScript file referenced by Outlook on the web and Mac, you can implement a later ECMAScript specification in that file.

### Debug your add-in

- As you make changes to your add-in, be aware that:
  - If you update the manifest, [remove the add-in](sideload-outlook-add-ins-for-testing.md#remove-a-sideloaded-add-in), then sideload it again. If you're using Outlook on Windows, you must also close and reopen Outlook.
  - If you make changes to files other than the manifest, close and reopen the Outlook client on Windows or on Mac, or refresh the browser tab running Outlook on the web.
  - If you're still unable to see your changes after performing these steps, [clear your Office cache](../testing/clear-cache.md).
- As you test your add-in in Outlook on Windows:
  - Check [Event Viewer](/shows/inside/event-viewer) for any reported add-in errors.
    1. In Event Viewer, select **Windows Logs** > **Application**.
    1. From the **Actions** panel, select **Filter Current Log**.
    1. From the **Logged** dropdown, select your preferred log time frame.
    1. Select the **Error** checkbox.
    1. In the **Event IDs** field, enter **63**.
    1. Select **OK** to apply your filters.

    :::image type="content" source="../images/outlook-event-based-logs.png" alt-text="A sample of Event Viewer's Filter Current Log settings configured to only show Outlook errors with event ID 63 that occurred in the last hour.":::

  - Verify that the **bundle.js** file is downloaded to the following folder in File Explorer. Replace text enclosed in `[]` with your applicable information.
  
    ```text
    %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Wef\{[Outlook profile GUID]}\[Outlook mail account encoding]\Javascript\[Add-in ID]_[Add-in Version]_[locale]
    ```

    [!INCLUDE [outlook-bundle-js](../includes/outlook-bundle-js.md)]

- As you test your add-in in Outlook on Windows or Mac, enable runtime logging to identify possible manifest and add-in installation issues. For guidance on how to use runtime logging, see [Debug your add-in with runtime logging](../testing/runtime-logging.md).
- Set breakpoints in your code to debug your add-in. For platform-specific instructions, see [Debug your event-based Outlook add-in](debug-autolaunch.md).

### Seek additional help

If you still need help after performing the recommended troubleshooting steps, [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=). Include screenshots, video recordings, or runtime logs to supplement your report.

## Deploy to users

Event-based add-ins are restricted to admin-managed deployments only, even if they're acquired from AppSource. If users acquire the add-in from AppSource or the in-app Office Store, they won't be able to activate the event-based function of the add-in. To learn more about listing your event-based add-in in AppSource, see [AppSource listing options for your event-based Outlook add-in](autolaunch-store-options.md).

Admin deployments are done by uploading the manifest to the Microsoft 365 admin center. In the admin portal, expand the **Settings** section in the navigation pane then select **Integrated apps**. On the **Integrated apps** page, choose the **Upload custom apps** action.

![The Integrated apps page on the Microsoft 365 admin center with the Upload custom apps action highlighted.](../images/outlook-deploy-event-based-add-ins.png)

[!INCLUDE [outlook-smart-alerts-deployment](../includes/outlook-smart-alerts-deployment.md)]

### Deploy manifest updates

Because event-based add-ins are deployed by admins, any change you make to the manifest requires admin consent through the Microsoft 365 admin center. Until the admin accepts your changes, users in their organization are blocked from using the add-in. To learn more about the admin consent process, see [Admin consent for installing event-based add-ins](autolaunch-store-options.md#admin-consent-for-installing-event-based-add-ins).

## Event-based activation behavior and limitations

Add-in launch-event handlers are expected to be short-running, lightweight, and as noninvasive as possible. After activation, your add-in will time out within approximately 300 seconds, the maximum length of time allowed for running event-based add-ins. To signal that your add-in has completed processing a launch event, your associated event handler must call the [event.completed](/javascript/api/outlook/office.mailboxevent#outlook-office-mailboxevent-completed-member(1)) method. (Note that code included after the `event.completed` statement isn't guaranteed to run.) Each time an event that your add-in handles is triggered, the add-in is reactivated and runs the associated event handler, and the timeout window is reset. The add-in ends after it times out, or the user closes the compose window or sends the item.

If the user has multiple add-ins that subscribed to the same event, the Outlook platform launches the add-ins in no particular order. Currently, only five event-based add-ins can be actively running.

In all supported Outlook clients, the user must remain on the current mail item where the add-in was activated for it to complete running. Navigating away from the current item (for example, switching to another compose window or tab) terminates the add-in operation. The add-in also ceases operation when the user sends the message or appointment they're composing.

When developing an event-based add-in to run in the Outlook on Windows client, be mindful of the following:

- Imports aren't supported in the JavaScript file where you implement the handling for event-based activation.
- Add-ins don't run code included in `Office.onReady()` and `Office.initialize`. We recommend adding any startup logic, such as checking the user's Outlook version, to your event handlers instead.
- Only the JavaScript file referenced in the manifest is supported for event-based activation. You must bundle your event-handling JavaScript code into this single file. The location of the referenced JavaScript file in the manifest varies depending on the type of manifest your add-in uses.
  - **XML manifest**: **\<Override\>** child element of the **\<Runtime\>** node
  - **Unified manifest for Microsoft 365 (preview)**: "script" property of the "code" object

  Note that a large JavaScript bundle may cause issues with the performance of your add-in. We recommend preprocessing heavy operations, so that they're not included in your event-handling code.

Some Office.js APIs that change or alter the UI aren't allowed from event-based add-ins. The following are the blocked APIs.

- Under `Office.context.auth`:
  - `getAccessToken`
  - `getAccessTokenAsync`
    > [!NOTE]
    > [OfficeRuntime.auth](/javascript/api/office-runtime/officeruntime.auth) is supported in all Outlook versions that support event-based activation and single sign-on (SSO), while [Office.auth](/javascript/api/office/office.auth) is only supported in certain Outlook builds. For more information, see [Enable single sign-on (SSO) or cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) in your event-based Outlook add-in](use-sso-in-event-based-activation.md).
- Under `Office.context.mailbox`:
  - `displayAppointmentForm`
  - `displayMessageForm`
  - `displayNewAppointmentForm`
  - `displayNewMessageForm`
- Under `Office.context.mailbox.item`:
  - `close`
- Under `Office.context.ui`:
  - `displayDialogAsync`
  - `messageParent`

### Preview features in event handlers (Outlook on Windows)

Outlook on Windows includes a local copy of the production and beta versions of Office.js instead of loading from the content delivery network (CDN). By default, the local production copy of the API is referenced. To reference the local beta copy of the API, you must configure your computer's registry. This will enable you to test [preview features](/javascript/api/requirement-sets/outlook/preview-requirement-set/outlook-requirement-set-preview) in your event handlers in Outlook on Windows.

1. In the registry, navigate to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Outlook\Options\WebExt\Developer`. If the key doesn't exist, create it.
1. Create an entry named `EnableBetaAPIsInJavaScript` and set its value to `1`.

    ![The EnableBetaAPIsInJavaScript registry value is set to 1."](../images/outlook-beta-registry-key.png)

### Enable single sign-on (SSO)

To enable SSO in your event-based add-in, you must add its JavaScript file to a well-known URI. For guidance on how to configure this resource, see [Enable single sign-on (SSO) or cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) in your event-based Outlook add-in](use-sso-in-event-based-activation.md).

### Request external data

You can request external data by using an API like [Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) or by using [XMLHttpRequest (XHR)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest), a standard web API that issues HTTP requests to interact with servers.

Be aware that you must use additional security measures when using XMLHttpRequest objects, requiring [Same Origin Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy) and simple [CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS).

A [simple CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#simple_requests) implementation:

- Can't use cookies.
- Only supports simple methods, such as `GET`, `HEAD`, and `POST`.
- Accepts simple headers with field names `Accept`, `Accept-Language`, or `Content-Language`.
- Can use the `Content-Type`, provided that the content type is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `text/plain`, or `multipart/form-data`.
- Can't have event listeners registered on the object returned by `XMLHttpRequest.upload`.
- Can't use `ReadableStream` objects in requests.

To enable your event-based add-in to make CORS request, you must add the add-in and its JavaScript file to a well-known URI. For guidance on how to configure this resource, see [Enable single sign-on (SSO) or cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) in your event-based Outlook add-in](use-sso-in-event-based-activation.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Full CORS support is available in Outlook on the web, Mac, and Windows (starting in Version 2201, Build 16.0.14813.10000).
