# Configure your Outlook add-in for event-based activation

Without the event-based activation feature, a user has to explicitly launch an add-in to complete their tasks. This feature enables your add-in to run tasks based on certain events, particularly for operations that apply to every item. You can also integrate with the task pane and UI-less functionality.

By the end of this walkthrough, you'll have an add-in that runs whenever a new item is created and sets the subject.

> [!NOTE]
> Support for this feature was introduced in [requirement set 1.10](/javascript/api/requirement-sets/outlook/requirement-set-1.10/outlook-requirement-set-1.10). See [clients and platforms](/javascript/api/requirement-sets/outlook/outlook-api-requirement-sets#requirement-sets-supported-by-exchange-servers-and-outlook-clients) that support this requirement set.

## Supported events

The following table lists events that are currently available and the supported clients for each event. When an event is raised, the handler receives an `event` object which may include details specific to the type of event. The **Description** column includes a link to the related object where applicable.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Events still in preview may only be available with a Microsoft 365 subscription and in a limited set of supported clients as noted in the following table. For client configuration details, see [How to preview](#how-to-preview) in this article. Preview events shouldn't be used in production add-ins.

  - The minimum required build is 16.0.14511.10000. Join the [Office Insider program](https://insider.office.com/join/windows) and choose the **Beta Channel** for access to Office beta builds.

## Set up your environment

Complete the [Outlook quick start](../quickstarts/outlook-quickstart.md?tabs=yeomangenerator) which creates an add-in project with the Yeoman generator for Office Add-ins.

## Configure the manifest

To enable event-based activation of your add-in, you must configure the [Runtimes](/javascript/api/manifest/runtimes) element and [LaunchEvent](/javascript/api/manifest/extensionpoint#launchevent) extension point in the `VersionOverridesV1_1` node of the manifest. For now, `DesktopFormFactor` is the only supported form factor.

1. In your code editor, open the quick start project.

1. Open the **manifest.xml** file located at the root of your project.

1. Select the entire **\<VersionOverrides\>** node (including open and close tags) and replace it with the following XML, then save your changes.

```XML
<VersionOverrides xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/mailappversionoverrides" xsi:type="VersionOverridesV1_0">

Outlook on Windows uses a JavaScript file, while Outlook on the web and on the new Mac UI use an HTML file that can reference the same JavaScript file. You must provide references to both these files in the `Resources` node of the manifest as the Outlook platform ultimately determines whether to use HTML or JavaScript based on the Outlook client. As such, to configure event handling, provide the location of the HTML in the `Runtime` element, then in its `Override` child element provide the location of the JavaScript file inlined or referenced by the HTML.

> [!TIP]
> To learn more about manifests for Outlook add-ins, see [Outlook add-in manifests](manifests.md).

## Implement event handling

You have to implement handling for your selected events.

In this scenario, you'll add handling for composing new items.

1. From the same quick start project, create a new folder named **launchevent** under the **./src** directory.

1. In the **./src/launchevent** folder, create a new file named **launchevent.js**.

1. Open the file **./src/launchevent/launchevent.js** in your code editor and add the following JavaScript code.

    ```js
    /*
    * Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. Licensed under the MIT license.
    * See LICENSE in the project root for license information.
    */

    function onMessageComposeHandler(event) {
      setSubject(event);
    }
    function onAppointmentComposeHandler(event) {
      setSubject(event);
    }
    function setSubject(event) {
      Office.context.mailbox.item.subject.setAsync(
        "Set by an event-based add-in!",
        {
          "asyncContext": event
        },
        function (asyncResult) {
          // Handle success or error.
          if (asyncResult.status !== Office.AsyncResultStatus.Succeeded) {
            console.error("Failed to set subject: " + JSON.stringify(asyncResult.error));
          }

          // Call event.completed() after all work is done.
          asyncResult.asyncContext.completed();
        });
    }

    // 1st parameter: FunctionName of LaunchEvent in the manifest; 2nd parameter: Its implementation in this .js file.
    Office.actions.associate("onMessageComposeHandler", onMessageComposeHandler);
    Office.actions.associate("onAppointmentComposeHandler", onAppointmentComposeHandler);
    ```

1. Save your changes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Windows: At present, imports are not supported in the JavaScript file where you implement the handling for event-based activation.

## Update the commands HTML file

1. In the **./src/commands** folder, open **commands.html**.

1. Immediately before the closing **head** tag (`<\head>`), add a script entry to include the event-handling JavaScript code.

    ```html
    <script type="text/javascript" src="../launchevent/launchevent.js"></script>
    ```

1. Save your changes.

## Update webpack config settings

1. Open the **webpack.config.js** file found in the root directory of the project and complete the following steps.

1. Locate the `plugins` array within the `config` object and add this new object at the beginning of the array.

    ```js
    new CopyWebpackPlugin({
      patterns: [
        {
          from: "./src/launchevent/launchevent.js",
          to: "launchevent.js",
        },
      ],
    }),
    ```

1. Save your changes.

## Try it out

1. Run the following commands in the root directory of your project. When you run `npm start`, the local web server will start (if it's not already running) and your add-in will be sideloaded.

    ```command&nbsp;line
    npm run build
    ```
    ```command&nbsp;line
    npm start
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If your add-in wasn't automatically sideloaded, then follow the instructions in [Sideload Outlook add-ins for testing](../outlook/sideload-outlook-add-ins-for-testing.md#sideload-manually) to manually sideload the add-in in Outlook.

1. In Outlook on the web, create a new message.

    ![A message window in Outlook on the web with the subject set on compose.](../images/outlook-web-autolaunch-1.png)

1. In Outlook on the new Mac UI, create a new message.

    ![A message window in Outlook on the new Mac UI with the subject set on compose.](../images/outlook-mac-autolaunch.png)

1. In Outlook on Windows, create a new message.

    ![A message window in Outlook on Windows with the subject set on compose.](../images/outlook-win-autolaunch.png)

## Debug

As you make changes to launch-event handling in your add-in, you should be aware that:

- If you updated the manifest, [remove the add-in](sideload-outlook-add-ins-for-testing.md#remove-a-sideloaded-add-in), then sideload it again. If you're using Outlook on Windows, then close and reopen it.
- If you made changes to files other than the manifest, close and reopen Outlook on Windows, or refresh the browser tab running Outlook on the web.

While implementing your own functionality, you may need to debug your code. For guidance on how to debug event-based add-in activation, see [Debug your event-based Outlook add-in](debug-autolaunch.md).

Runtime logging is also available for this feature on Windows. For more information, see [Debug your add-in with runtime logging](../testing/runtime-logging.md#runtime-logging-on-windows).

[!INCLUDE [Loopback exemption note](../includes/outlook-loopback-exemption.md)]

## Deploy to users

You can deploy event-based add-ins by uploading the manifest through the Microsoft 365 admin center. In the admin portal, expand the **Settings** section in the navigation pane then select **Integrated apps**. On the **Integrated apps** page, choose the **Upload custom apps** action.

![The Integrated apps page on the Microsoft 365 admin center, including the Upload custom apps action.](../images/outlook-deploy-event-based-add-ins.png)

AppSource and in-app Office Store: The ability to deploy event-based add-ins or update existing add-ins to include the event-based activation feature should be available soon.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Event-based add-ins are restricted to admin-managed deployments only. For now, users can't get event-based add-ins from AppSource or in-app Office Store. To learn more, refer to [AppSource listing options for your event-based Outlook add-in](autolaunch-store-options.md).

## Event-based activation behavior and limitations

Add-in launch-event handlers are expected to be short-running, lightweight, and as noninvasive as possible. After activation, your add-in will time out within approximately 300 seconds, the maximum length of time allowed for running event-based add-ins. To signal that your add-in has completed processing a launch event, we recommend you have the associated handler call the `event.completed` method. (Note that code included after the `event.completed` statement is not guaranteed to run.) Each time an event that your add-in handles is triggered, the add-in is reactivated and runs the associated event handler, and the timeout window is reset. The add-in ends after it times out, or the user closes the compose window or sends the item.

If the user has multiple add-ins that subscribed to the same event, the Outlook platform launches the add-ins in no particular order. Currently, only five event-based add-ins can be actively running.

The user can switch or navigate away from the current mail item where the add-in started running. The add-in that was launched will finish its operation in the background.

Imports are not supported in the JavaScript file where you implement the handling for event-based activation in the Windows client.

Some Office.js APIs that change or alter the UI are not allowed from event-based add-ins. The following are the blocked APIs.

- Under `Office.context.auth`:
  - `getAccessToken`
  - `getAccessTokenAsync`
    > [!NOTE]
    > [OfficeRuntime.auth](/javascript/api/office-runtime/officeruntime.auth) is supported in all Outlook versions that support event-based activation and single sign-on (SSO), while [Office.auth](/javascript/api/office/office.auth) is only supported in certain Outlook builds. For more information, see [Enable single sign-on (SSO) in Outlook add-ins that use event-based activation](use-sso-in-event-based-activation.md).
- Under `Office.context.mailbox`:
  - `displayAppointmentForm`
  - `displayMessageForm`
  - `displayNewAppointmentForm`
  - `displayNewMessageForm`
- Under `Office.context.mailbox.item`:
  - `close`
- Under `Office.context.ui`:
  - `displayDialogAsync`
  - `messageParent`

### Requesting external data

You can request external data by using an API like [Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) or by using [XmlHttpRequest (XHR)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest), a standard web API that issues HTTP requests to interact with servers.

Be aware that you must use additional security measures when making XmlHttpRequests, requiring [Same Origin Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy) and simple [CORS](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/).

A simple CORS implementation cannot use cookies and only supports simple methods (GET, HEAD, POST). Simple CORS accepts simple headers with field names `Accept`, `Accept-Language`, `Content-Language`. You can also use a `Content-Type` header in simple CORS, provided that the content type is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `text/plain`, or `multipart/form-data`.

Full CORS support is coming soon.
