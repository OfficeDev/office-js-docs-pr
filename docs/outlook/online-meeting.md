# Create an Outlook add-in for an online-meeting provider

Setting up an online meeting is a core experience for an Outlook user, and it's easy to [create a Teams meeting with Outlook](/microsoftteams/teams-add-in-for-outlook). However, creating an online meeting in Outlook with a non-Microsoft service can be cumbersome. By implementing this feature, service providers can streamline the online meeting creation and joining experience for their Outlook add-in users.

In this article, you'll learn how to set up your Outlook add-in to enable users to organize and join a meeting using your online-meeting service. Throughout this article, we'll use a fictional online-meeting service provider, "Contoso".

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is supported in Outlook on the web, Windows ([new](https://support.microsoft.com/office/656bb8d9-5a60-49b2-a98b-ba7822bc7627) and classic), Mac, Android, and iOS with a Microsoft 365 subscription.

## Set up your environment

Complete the [Outlook quick start](../quickstarts/outlook-quickstart-yo.md) in which you create an add-in project with the [Yeoman generator for Office Add-ins](../develop/yeoman-generator-overview.md).

## Configure the manifest

The steps for configuring the manifest depend on which type of manifest you selected in the quick start.

# [Unified manifest for Microsoft 365](#tab/jsonmanifest)

[!INCLUDE [outlook-unified-manifest-platforms](../includes/outlook-unified-manifest-platforms.md)]

1. Open the **manifest.json** file.

1. Find the *first* object in the [`"authorization.permissions.resourceSpecific"`](/microsoft-365/extensibility/schema/root-authorization-permissions#resourcespecific) array and set its `"name"` property to `"MailboxItem.ReadWrite.User"`. It should look like this when you're done.

    ```json
    {
        "name": "MailboxItem.ReadWrite.User",
        "type": "Delegated"
    }
    ```

1. In the [`"validDomains"`](/microsoft-365/extensibility/schema/root#validdomains) array, change the URL to `"https://contoso.com"`, which is the URL of the fictional online meeting provider. The array should look like this when you're done.

    ```json
    "validDomains": [
        "https://contoso.com"
    ],
    ```

1. Add the following object to the [`"extensions.runtimes"`](/microsoft-365/extensibility/schema/extension-runtimes-array?view=m365-app-prev&preserve-view=true) array. Note the following about this code.

   - The `"minVersion"` of the Mailbox requirement set is set to `"1.3"` so the runtime won't launch on platforms and Office versions where this feature isn't supported.
   - The `"id"` of the runtime is set to the descriptive name `"online_meeting_runtime"`.
   - The [`"code.page"`](/microsoft-365/extensibility/schema/extension-runtime-code#page) property is set to the URL of UI-less HTML file that will load the function command.
   - The `"lifetime"` property is set to `"short"` which means that the runtime starts up when the function command button is selected and shuts down when the function completes. (In certain rare cases, the runtime shuts down before the handler completes. See [Runtimes in Office Add-ins](../testing/runtimes.md).)
   - There's an action to run a function named `"insertContosoMeeting"`. You'll create this function in a later step.

    ```json
    {
        "requirements": {
            "capabilities": [
                {
                    "name": "Mailbox",
                    "minVersion": "1.3"
                }
            ],
            "formFactors": [
                "desktop"
            ]
        },
        "id": "online_meeting_runtime",
        "type": "general",
        "code": {
            "page": "https://contoso.com/commands.html"
        },
        "lifetime": "short",
        "actions": [
            {
                "id": "insertContosoMeeting",
                "type": "executeFunction",
                "displayName": "insertContosoMeeting"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

1. Replace the [`"extensions.ribbons"`](/microsoft-365/extensibility/schema/element-extensions#ribbons-property) array with the following. Note the following about this markup.

   - The `"minVersion"` of the Mailbox requirement set is set to `"1.3"` so the the ribbon customizations won't appear on platforms and Office versions where this feature is not supported.
   - The `"contexts"` array specifies that the ribbon is available only in the meeting details organizer window.
   - There will be a custom control group on the default ribbon tab (of the meeting details organizer window) labelled **Contoso meeting**.
   - The group will have a button labelled **Add meeting**.
   - The button's `"actionId"` has been set to `"insertContosoMeeting"`, which matches the `"id"` of the action you created in the previous step.

    ```json
    "ribbons": [
      {
        "requirements": {
            "capabilities": [
                {
                    "name": "Mailbox",
                    "minVersion": "1.3"
                }
            ],
            "scopes": [
                "mail"
            ],
            "formFactors": [
                "desktop"
            ]
        },
        "contexts": [
            "meetingDetailsOrganizer"
        ],
        "tabs": [
            {
                "builtInTabId": "TabDefault",
                "groups": [
                    {
                        "id": "apptComposeGroup",
                        "label": "Contoso meeting",
                        "controls": [
                            {
                                "id": "insertMeetingButton",
                                "type": "button",
                                "label": "Add meeting",
                                "icons": [
                                    {
                                        "size": 16,
                                        "url": "icon-16.png"
                                    },
                                    {
                                        "size": 32,
                                        "url": "icon-32.png"
                                    },
                                    {
                                        "size": 64,
                                        "url": "icon-64_02.png"
                                    },
                                    {
                                        "size": 80,
                                        "url": "icon-80.png"
                                    }
                                ],
                                "supertip": {
                                    "title": "Add a Contoso meeting",
                                    "description": "Add a Contoso meeting to this appointment."
                                },
                                "actionId": "insertContosoMeeting",
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
      }
    ]
    ```

### Add mobile support

1. Open the **manifest.json** file.

1. In the [`"extensions.ribbons.requirements.formFactors"`](/microsoft-365/extensibility/schema/requirements-extension-element#formfactors) array, add `"mobile"` as an item. When you're finished, the array should look like the following.

```json
"formFactors": [
    "desktop",
    "mobile"
]
```

1. In the [`"extensions.ribbons.contexts"`](/microsoft-365/extensibility/schema/extension-ribbons-array#contexts) array, add `onlineMeetingDetailsOrganizer` as an item. When you're finished, the array should look like the following.

```json
"contexts": [
    "meetingDetailsOrganizer",
    "onlineMeetingDetailsOrganizer"
],
```

1. In the [`"extensions.ribbons.tabs"`](/microsoft-365/extensibility/schema/extension-ribbons-array#tabs) array, find the tab with the `"builtInTabId"` of `"TabDefault"`. Add a child `"customMobileRibbonGroups"` array to it (as a peer of the existing `"groups"` property). When you're finished, the `"tabs"` array should look like the following:

```json
"tabs": [
    {
        "builtInTabId": "TabDefault",
        "groups": [
            <-- non-mobile group objects omitted -->
        ],
        "customMobileRibbonGroups": [
            {
                "id": "mobileApptComposeGroup",
                "label": "Contoso Meeting",
                "controls": [
                    { 
                        "id": "mobileInsertMeetingButton",
                        "label": "Add meeting",
                        "type": "mobileButton",
                        "actionId": "insertContosoMeeting",
                        "icons": [
                            {
                                "scale": 1,
                                "size": 25,
                               "url": "https://contoso.com/assets/icon-25.png"
                            },
                            {
                                "scale": 1,
                                "size": 32,
                                "url": "https://contoso.com/assets/icon-32.png"
                            },
                            {
                                "scale": 1,
                                "size": 48,
                                "url": "https://contoso.com/assets/icon-48.png"
                            },                                
                            {
                                "scale": 2,
                                "size": 25,

                            },
                            {
                                "scale": 2,

                            {
                                "scale": 2,
                                "size": 48,
                                "url": "https://contoso.com/assets/icon-48.png"
                            },                                
                            {
                                "scale": 3,
                                "size": 25,

                            },
                            {

                            },
                            {
                                "scale": 3,

                        ]
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
]  
```

# [Add-in only manifest](#tab/xmlmanifest)

1. In your code editor, open the Outlook quick start project you created.

1. Open the **manifest.xml** file located at the root of your project.

1. Select the entire `<VersionOverrides>` node (including open and close tags) and replace it with the following XML.

```xml
<VersionOverrides xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/mailappversionoverrides" xsi:type="VersionOverridesV1_0">

</VersionOverrides>
```

### Add mobile support

To allow users to create an online meeting from their mobile device, the [MobileOnlineMeetingCommandSurface extension point](/javascript/api/manifest/extensionpoint#mobileonlinemeetingcommandsurface) is configured in the manifest under the parent element `<MobileFormFactor>`. This extension point isn't supported in other form factors.

1. In your code editor, open the Outlook quick start project you created.

1. Open the **manifest.xml** file located at the root of your project.

1. Add the following markup as the second child of the **\<Host xsi:type="MailHost"\>** element. It should be a peer of the `<DesktopFormFactor>` element.

```xml
<MobileFormFactor>
  <FunctionFile resid="residFunctionFile"/>
  <ExtensionPoint xsi:type="MobileOnlineMeetingCommandSurface">
    <Control xsi:type="MobileButton" id="insertMeetingButton">
      <Label resid="residLabel"/>
      <Icon>
        <bt:Image size="25" scale="1" resid="icon-16"/>
        <bt:Image size="25" scale="2" resid="icon-16"/>
        <bt:Image size="25" scale="3" resid="icon-16"/>

        <bt:Image size="32" scale="1" resid="icon-32"/>
        <bt:Image size="32" scale="2" resid="icon-32"/>
        <bt:Image size="32" scale="3" resid="icon-32"/>

        <bt:Image size="48" scale="1" resid="icon-48"/>
        <bt:Image size="48" scale="2" resid="icon-48"/>
        <bt:Image size="48" scale="3" resid="icon-48"/>
      </Icon>
      <Action xsi:type="ExecuteFunction">
        <FunctionName>insertContosoMeeting</FunctionName>
      </Action>
    </Control>
  </ExtensionPoint>
</MobileFormFactor>
```

## Implement adding online meeting details

In this section, learn how your add-in script can update a user's meeting to include online meeting details. The following applies to all supported platforms.

1. From the same quick start project, open the file **./src/commands/commands.js** in your code editor.

1. Replace the entire content of the **commands.js** file with the following JavaScript.

## Test and validate your add-in

Follow the usual guidance to [test and validate your add-in](testing-and-tips.md), then [sideload](sideload-outlook-add-ins-for-testing.md) the manifest in Outlook on the web, on Windows (new or classic), or on Mac. If your add-in also supports mobile, restart Outlook on your Android or iOS device after sideloading. Once the add-in is sideloaded, create a new meeting and verify that the Microsoft Teams or Skype toggle is replaced with your own.

### Create meeting UI

As a meeting organizer, you should see screens similar to the following three images when you create a meeting.

[![The create meeting screen on Android with the Contoso toggle off.](../images/outlook-android-create-online-meeting-off.png)](../images/outlook-android-create-online-meeting-off-expanded.png#lightbox) [![The create meeting screen on Android with a loading Contoso toggle.](../images/outlook-android-create-online-meeting-load.png)](../images/outlook-android-create-online-meeting-load-expanded.png#lightbox) [![The create meeting screen on Android with the Contoso toggle on.](../images/outlook-android-create-online-meeting-on.png)](../images/outlook-android-create-online-meeting-on-expanded.png#lightbox)

### Join meeting UI

As a meeting attendee, you should see a screen similar to the following image when you view the meeting.

[![The join meeting screen on Android.](../images/outlook-android-join-online-meeting-view-1.png)](../images/outlook-android-join-online-meeting-view-1-expanded.png#lightbox)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Join** button is only supported in Outlook on the web, on Mac, on Android, on iOS, and in new Outlook on Windows. If you only see a meeting link, but don't see the **Join** button in a supported client, it may be that the online-meeting template for your service isn't registered on our servers. See the [Register your online-meeting template](#register-your-online-meeting-template) section for details.

## Register your online-meeting template

Registering your online-meeting add-in is optional. It only applies if you want to surface the **Join** button in meetings, in addition to the meeting link. Once you've published your online-meeting add-in and would like to register it, create a GitHub issue using the following guidance. We'll contact you to coordinate a registration timeline.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - The **Join** button is only supported in Outlook on the web, on Mac, on Android, on iOS, and in new Outlook on Windows.
> - Only online-meeting add-ins published to AppSource can be registered. Line-of-business add-ins aren't supported.

1. Create a [new GitHub issue](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js/issues/new).
1. Set the **Title** of the new issue to "Outlook: Register the online-meeting template for my-service", replacing `my-service` with your service name.
1. In the issue body, replace the existing text with the following:
    - The asset ID of your published add-in.
    - The string you set in the `newBody` or similar variable from the [Implement adding online meeting details](#implement-adding-online-meeting-details) section earlier in this article.
1. Click **Submit new issue**.

## Automatically provide post-meeting resources and updates to attendees

After a meeting ends, the organizer and attendees often need access to important resources such as video recordings or meeting transcripts. If available, your online-meeting add-in can automatically update the meeting invite with these resources, making them easily accessible to all participants.

This section outlines how to use the Microsoft Graph API to update a calendar item with post-meeting resources. The updated content of a meeting will be reflected in the calendars of the organizer and the attendees. Additionally, an update will be sent to the attendees.

This implementation requires the following:
- An access token to make Microsoft Graph API calls. For guidance, see [Use the Microsoft Graph REST API from an Outlook add-in](microsoft-graph.md).
- An indicator to your add-in when a meeting scheduled with your online-meeting add-in has ended.
- Access to a meeting's Exchange ID and the ID assigned by the add-in.
- Access to the necessary resources that will be added to the meeting.
- Access to the meeting instance created by the organizer. Changes must be made to the organizer's meeting instance to propagate to the attendees' meeting instance.

1. When a meeting ends, configure your add-in to fetch the resources that will be added to the meeting object.
1. Use the Microsoft Graph API to get the organizer's meeting instance. Ensure that the `body` property is included in the request. For information on the API, see [Get event](/graph/api/event-get).
1. Update the body of the meeting with the applicable meeting resources. For information on the API, see [Update event](/graph/api/event-update).

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > When making changes to the `body` property of a meeting, make sure to preserve the online meeting blob. Removing the meeting blob from the body disables the online-meeting functionality.

Once the meeting resources have been added to the meeting, an update is sent to the attendees. The changes are also reflected in the calendar instances of the organizer and the attendees.

The following is an example of how to update the meeting body with a link to a video recording.

```javascript
const options = {
    authProvider,
};

const client = Client.init(options);

// Get the body of the meeting.
const currentEvent = await client.api('/users/{organizerId}/events/{meetingId}')
    .select('body')
    .get();

const existingBody = currentEvent.body.content;

// Update the body with a link to a video recording.
const meetingResources = `
<br><br>
<h2>Meeting summary</h2>
<p>The team discussed monthly sales targets for Fabrikam. Current market conditions were discussed. A follow-up meeting will be scheduled to finalize revenue goals for the quarter.</p>
<a href="https://contoso.com/recording/123456789" target="_blank">View recording</a>
`;

const updatedBody = existingBody + meetingResources;

const updatedEvent = {
  body: {
    contentType: 'html',
    content: updatedBody
  }
};

// Update the event with the new body content.
await client.api('/users/{organizerId}/events/{meetingId}')
    .update(updatedEvent);
```
