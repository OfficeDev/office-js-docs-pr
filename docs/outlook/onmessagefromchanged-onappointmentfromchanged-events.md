# Automatically update your signature when switching between Exchange accounts

Applying the correct signature to messages when using multiple Exchange accounts is now made easier with the addition of the `OnMessageFromChanged` and `OnAppointmentFromChanged` events to the [event-based activation](autolaunch.md) feature. The `OnMessageFromChanged` event occurs when the account in the **From** field of a message being composed is changed, while the `OnAppointmentFromChanged` event occurs when the organizer of a meeting being composed is changed. These events further extend the capabilities of signature add-ins and allow them to:

- Provide users with the convenience to apply custom signatures for each of their accounts.
- Enable mailbox delegates to more accurately and efficiently manage outgoing messages and meeting requests from multiple mailboxes.
- Ensure that users' messages and appointments meet their organization's communication and marketing policies.

The following sections walk you through how to develop an event-based add-in that handles the `OnMessageFromChanged` event to automatically update a message's signature when the mail account in the **From** field is changed.

> [!NOTE]
> The `OnMessageFromChanged` and `OnAppointmentFromChanged` events were introduced in [requirement set 1.13](/javascript/api/requirement-sets/outlook/requirement-set-1.13/outlook-requirement-set-1.13). For information about client support for these events, see [Supported clients and platforms](#supported-clients-and-platforms).

## Supported clients and platforms

The following tables list client-server combinations that support the `OnMessageFromChanged` and `OnAppointmentFromChanged` events. Select the tab for the applicable event.

## Prerequisites

To test the walkthrough, you must have at least two Exchange accounts.

## Set up your environment

Complete the [Outlook quick start](../quickstarts/outlook-quickstart-yo.md), which creates an add-in project with the [Yeoman generator for Office Add-ins](../develop/yeoman-generator-overview.md).

## Configure the manifest

# [Unified manifest for Microsoft 365](#tab/jsonmanifest)

1. Open the **manifest.json** file.

1. Navigate to the "authorization.permissions.resourceSpecific" array. In the array object, replace the value of the "name" property with "MailboxItem.ReadWrite.User". This is needed by the add-in to be able to update the signature of a message.

    ```json
    ...
    "authorization": {
        "permissions": {
            "resourceSpecific": [
                {
                    "name": "MailboxItem.ReadWrite.User",
                    "type": "Delegated"
                }
            ]
        }
    },
    ...
    ```

1. Add the following object to the "extensions.runtimes" array. Note the following about this markup.

   - The "minVersion" of the Mailbox requirement set is configured as "1.13" because this is the lowest version of the requirement set that supports the `OnMessageFromChanged` event. For more information, see the "Supported events" table in [Configure your Outlook add-in for event-based activation](autolaunch.md#supported-events).
   - The "id" of the runtime is set to a descriptive name, "autorun_runtime".
   - The "code" property has a child "page" property set to an HTML file and a child "script" property set to a JavaScript file. You'll create or edit these files in later steps. Office uses one of these values depending on the platform.
       - Classic Outlook on Windows executes the event handler in a JavaScript-only runtime, which loads a JavaScript file directly.
       - Outlook on the web and on Mac, and new Outlook on Windows execute the handler in a browser runtime, which loads an HTML file. The HTML file contains a `<script>` tag that then loads the JavaScript file.

     For more information, see [Runtimes in Office Add-ins](../testing/runtimes.md).
   - The "lifetime" property is set to "short". This means the runtime starts up when the event occurs and shuts down when the handler completes.
   - There are "actions" to run handlers for the `OnMessageFromChanged` and `OnNewMessageCompose` events. You'll create the handlers in a later step.

    ```json
    {
        "requirements": {
            "capabilities": [
                {
                    "name": "Mailbox",
                    "minVersion": "1.13"
                }
            ]
        },
        "id": "autorun_runtime",
        "type": "general",
        "code": {
            "page": "https://localhost:3000/commands.html",
            "script": "https://localhost:3000/launchevent.js"
        },
        "lifetime": "short",
        "actions": [
            {
                "id": "onMessageFromChangedHandler",
                "type": "executeFunction",
                "displayName": "onMessageFromChangedHandler"
            },
            {
                "id": "onNewMessageComposeHandler",
                "type": "executeFunction",
                "displayName": "onNewMessageComposeHandler"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

1. Add an "autoRunEvents" array as a property of the object in the "extensions" array. The "autoRunEvents" array contains an object with the following key properties.

    - The "events" property assigns handlers to the `OnMessageFromChanged` and `OnNewMessageCompose` events. For information on event names used in the unified manifest, see the "Supported events" table in [Configure your Outlook add-in for event-based activation](autolaunch.md#supported-events).
    - The function name provided in "actionId" must match the "id" property of its corresponding object in the "actions" array configured earlier.

    ```json
    "autoRunEvents": [
        {
            "requirements": {
                "capabilities": [
                    {
                        "name": "Mailbox",
                        "minVersion": "1.13"
                    }
                ],
                "scopes": [
                    "mail"
                ]
            },
            "events": [
                {
                    "type": "messageFromChanged",
                    "actionId": "onMessageFromChangedHandler"
                },
                {
                    "type": "newMessageComposeCreated",
                    "actionId": "onNewMessageComposeHandler"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
    ```

# [Add-in only manifest](#tab/xmlmanifest)

To enable the add-in to activate when the `OnMessageFromChanged` event occurs, the [Runtimes](/javascript/api/manifest/runtimes) element and [LaunchEvent](/javascript/api/manifest/extensionpoint#launchevent) extension point must be configured in the `VersionOverridesV1_1` node of the manifest.

In addition to the `OnMessageFromChanged` event, the `OnNewMessageCompose` event is also configured in the manifest, so that a signature is added to a message being composed if a default Outlook signature isn't already configured on the current account.

1. In your code editor, open the quick start project.

1. Open the **manifest.xml** file located at the root of your project.

1. Select the entire **\<VersionOverrides\>** node (including open and close tags), replace it with the following XML, then save your changes.

   ```xml
   <VersionOverrides xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/mailappversionoverrides" xsi:type="VersionOverridesV1_0">

## Implement the event handlers

Event handlers must be configured for the `OnNewMessageCompose` and `OnMessageFromChanged` events. The `onNewMessageComposeHandler` function adds a signature to a newly created message if a default one isn't already configured on the current account. When the account in the **From** field is changed, the `onMessageFromChangedHandler` function updates the signature based on this newly selected account.

1. From the same quick start project, navigate to the **./src** directory, then create a new folder named **launchevent**.

1. In the **./src/launchevent** folder, create a new file named **launchevent.js**.

1. Open the file **./src/launchevent/launchevent.js** in your code editor and add the following JavaScript code.

    ```javascript
    /*
     * Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. Licensed under the MIT license.
     * See LICENSE in the project root for license information.
     */

    // The OnNewMessageCompose event handler that adds a signature to a new message.
    function onNewMessageComposeHandler(event) {
        const item = Office.context.mailbox.item;
    
        // Check if a default Outlook signature is already configured.
        item.isClientSignatureEnabledAsync({ asyncContext: event }, (result) => {
            if (result.status === Office.AsyncResultStatus.Failed) {
                console.log(result.error.message);
                return;
            }
    
            // Add a signature if there's no default Outlook signature configured.
            if (result.value === false) {
                item.body.setSignatureAsync(
                    "<i>This is a sample signature.</i>",
                    { asyncContext: result.asyncContext, coercionType: Office.CoercionType.Html },
                    addSignatureCallback
                );
            }
        });
    }
    
    // The OnMessageFromChanged event handler that updates the signature when the email address in the From field is changed.
    function onMessageFromChangedHandler(event) {
        const item = Office.context.mailbox.item;
        const signatureIcon =
        "iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACcAAAAnCAMAAAC7faEHAAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAAAzUExURQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKMFRskAAAAQdFJOUwAQIDBAUGBwgI+fr7/P3+8jGoKKAAAACXBIWXMAAA7DAAAOwwHHb6hkAAABT0lEQVQ4T7XT2ZalIAwF0DAJhMH+/6+tJOQqot6X6joPiouNBo3w9/Hd6+hrYnUt6vhLcjEAJevVW0zJxABSlcunhERpjY+UKoNN5+ZgDGu2onNz0OngjP2FM1VdyBW1LtvGeYrBLs7U5I1PTXZt+zifcS3Icw2GcS3vxRY3Vn/iqx31hUyTnV515kdTfbaNhZLI30AceqDiIo4tyKEmJpKdP5M4um+nUwfDWxAXdzqMNKQ14jLdL5ntXzxcRF440mhS6yu882Kxa30RZcUIjTCJg7lscsR4VsMjfX9Q0Vuv/Wd3YosD1J4LuSRtaL7bzXGN1wx2cytUdncDuhA3fu6HPTiCvpQUIjZ3sCcHVbvLtbNTHlysx2w9/s27m9gEb+7CTri6hR1wcTf2gVf3wBRe3CMbcHYvTODkXhnD0+178K/pZ9+n/C1ru/2HAPwAo7YM1X4+tLMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=";
    
        // Get the currently selected From account.
        item.from.getAsync({ asyncContext: event }, (result) => {
            if (result.status === Office.AsyncResultStatus.Failed) {
                console.log(result.error.message);
                return;
            }
    
            // Create a signature based on the currently selected From account.
            const name = result.value.displayName;
            const options = { asyncContext: { event: result.asyncContext, name: name }, isInline: true };
            item.addFileAttachmentFromBase64Async(signatureIcon, "signatureIcon.png", options, (result) => {
                if (result.status === Office.AsyncResultStatus.Failed) {
                    console.log(result.error.message);
                    return;
                }
        
                // Add the created signature to the mail item.
                const signature = "<img src='cid:signatureIcon.png'>" + result.asyncContext.name;
                item.body.setSignatureAsync(
                    signature,
                    { asyncContext: result.asyncContext.event, coercionType: Office.CoercionType.Html },
                    addSignatureCallback
                );
            });
        });
    }
    
    // Callback function to add a signature to the mail item.
    function addSignatureCallback(result) {
        if (result.status === Office.AsyncResultStatus.Failed) {
            console.log(result.error.message);
            return;
        }
    
        console.log("Successfully added signature.");
        result.asyncContext.completed();
    }
    
    // IMPORTANT: To ensure your add-in is supported in Outlook, remember to
    // map the event handler name specified in the manifest's LaunchEvent element (with the add-in only manifest)
    // or the "autoRunEvents.events.actionId" property (with the unified manifest for Microsoft 365)
    // to its JavaScript counterpart.
    Office.actions.associate("onNewMessageComposeHandler", onNewMessageComposeHandler);
    Office.actions.associate("onMessageFromChangedHandler", onMessageFromChangedHandler);
    ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Windows: At present, imports aren't supported in the JavaScript file where you implement the handling for event-based activation.

> [!TIP]
> Event-based add-ins running in classic Outlook on Windows don't run code included in the `Office.onReady()` and `Office.initialize` functions. We recommend adding your add-in startup logic, such as checking the user's Outlook version, to your event handlers instead.

## Update the commands HTML file

1. From the **./src/commands** folder, open **commands.html**.

1. Add the following code below the existing **script** tag.

   ```html
   <script type="text/javascript" src="../launchevent/launchevent.js"></script>
   ```

1. Save your changes.

## Update webpack config settings

1. From the root directory of the project, open the **webpack.config.js** file.

1. Locate the `plugins` array within the `config` object and add the following new object to the beginning of the array.

    ```js
    new CopyWebpackPlugin({
      patterns: [
        {
          from: "./src/launchevent/launchevent.js",
          to: "launchevent.js",

1. Save your changes.

## Try it out

1. Run the following commands in the root directory of your project. When you run `npm start`, the local web server will start (if it isn't already running) and your add-in will be sideloaded.

    ```command&nbsp;line
    npm run build
    ```

    ```command&nbsp;line
    npm start
    ```

    [!INCLUDE [outlook-manual-sideloading](../includes/outlook-manual-sideloading.md)]

1. In your preferred Outlook client, create a new message. If you don't have a default Outlook signature configured, the add-in adds one to the newly created message.

1. Enable the **From** field, if applicable. For guidance on how to enable it, see the "Why is the From button missing?" section of [Change the account used to send email messages](https://support.microsoft.com/office/2bdd8d4f-e30f-4ec8-88a0-406ce7b23cc5).

1. Select **From**, then choose a different Exchange account. Alternatively, manually enter the Exchange email address by selecting **From** > **Other Email Address**. An updated signature is added to the message, replacing the previous one.

## Troubleshoot your add-in

For guidance on how to troubleshoot your event-based activation add-in, see [Troubleshoot event-based and spam-reporting add-ins](troubleshoot-event-based-and-spam-reporting-add-ins.md).

## Deploy to users

Similar to other event-based add-ins, add-ins that use the `OnMessageFromChanged` and `OnAppointmentFromChanged` events must be deployed by an organization's administrator. For guidance on how to deploy your add-in via the Microsoft 365 admin center, see the "Deploy to users" section of [Configure your Outlook add-in for event-based activation](autolaunch.md#deploy-to-users).

## Event behavior and limitations

Because the `OnMessageFromChanged` and `OnAppointmentFromChanged` events are supported through the event-based activation feature, the same behavior and limitations apply to add-ins that activate as a result of this event. For a detailed description, see [Event-based activation behavior and limitations](autolaunch.md#event-based-activation-behavior-and-limitations).

In addition to these characteristics, the following aspects also apply when an add-in activates on these events.

- The `OnMessageFromChanged` event is only supported in message compose mode, while the `OnAppointmentFromChanged` event is only supported in appointment compose mode.
- In classic Outlook on Windows, only the `OnMessageFromChanged` event is supported.
- The `OnMessageFromChanged` and `OnAppointmentFromChanged` events only support Exchange accounts. In messages being composed, the Exchange account is selected from the **From** field dropdown list or manually entered in the field. In appointments being composed, the Exchange account is selected from the organizer field dropdown list. If a user switches to a non-Exchange account in the **From** or organizer field, the Outlook client automatically clears out the signature set by the previously selected account.
- Delegate and shared mailbox scenarios are supported.
- The `OnAppointmentFromChanged` event isn't supported in [Microsoft 365 group calendars](https://support.microsoft.com/office/0cf1ad68-1034-4306-b367-d75e9818376a#Outlook=Web). If a user switches from their Exchange account to a Microsoft 365 group calendar account in the organizer field, the Outlook client automatically clears out the signature set by the Exchange account.
- When switching to another Exchange account in the **From** or organizer field, the add-ins for the previously selected account, if any, are terminated, and the add-ins associated with the newly selected account are loaded before the `OnMessageFromChanged` or `OnAppointmentFromChanged` event is initiated.
- Email account aliases are supported. When an alias for the current account is selected in the **From** or organizer field, the `OnMessageFromChanged` or `OnAppointmentFromChanged` event occurs without reloading the account's add-ins.
- When the **From** or organizer field dropdown list is opened by mistake or the same account that appears in the **From** or organizer field is reselected, the `OnMessageFromChanged` or `OnAppointmentFromChanged` event occurs, but the account's add-ins aren't terminated or reloaded.
