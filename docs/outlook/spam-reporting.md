# Implement an integrated spam-reporting add-in (preview)

With the number of unsolicited emails on the rise, security is at the forefront of add-in usage. Currently, partner spam-reporting add-ins are added to the Outlook ribbon, but they usually appear towards the end of the ribbon or in the overflow menu. This makes it harder for users to locate the add-in to report unsolicited emails. In addition to configuring how messages are processed when they're reported, developers also need to complete additional tasks to show processing dialogs or supplemental information to the user.

The integrated spam-reporting feature eases the task of developing individual add-in components from scratch. More importantly, it displays your add-in in a prominent spot on the Outlook ribbon, making it easier for users to locate it and report spam messages. Implement this feature in your add-in to:

- Improve how unsolicited messages are tracked.
- Provide better guidance to users on how to report suspicious messages.
- Enable an organization's security operations center (SOC) or IT administrators to easily perform spam and phishing simulations for educational purposes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The integrated spam-reporting feature is currently in preview in Outlook on Windows. Features in preview shouldn't be used in production add-ins. We invite you to try out this feature in test or development environments and welcome feedback on your experience through GitHub (see the **Feedback** section at the end of this page).

## Preview the integrated spam-reporting feature

To preview the integrated spam-reporting feature in Outlook on Windows, you must install Version 2307 (Build 16626.10000) or later. Then, join the [Microsoft 365 Insider program](https://insider.microsoft365.com/join/Windows) and select the **Beta Channel** option to access Office beta builds.

## Set up your environment

Complete the [Outlook quick start](../quickstarts/outlook-quickstart.md?tabs=yeomangenerator), which creates an add-in project with the [Yeoman generator for Office Add-ins](../develop/yeoman-generator-overview.md).

## Configure the manifest

To implement the integrated spam-reporting feature in your add-in, you must configure the [VersionOverridesV1_1](/javascript/api/manifest/versionoverrides-1-1-mail) node of your manifest accordingly.

- In Outlook on Windows, an add-in that implements the integrated spam-reporting feature runs in a [JavaScript-only runtime](../testing/runtimes.md#javascript-only-runtime). As such, you must specify the JavaScript file that contains the code to handle the spam-reporting event in the [Override](/javascript/api/manifest/override) child element of the [Runtime](/javascript/api/manifest/runtime) element.
- To activate the add-in in the Outlook ribbon and prevent it from appearing at the end of the ribbon or in the overflow section, set the `xsi:type` attribute of the **\<ExtensionPoint\>** element to [ReportPhishingCommandSurface](/javascript/api/manifest/extensionpoint?view=outlook-js-preview&preserve-view=true#reportphishingcommandsurface-preview).
- To customize the ribbon button and preprocessing dialog, you must define the [ReportPhishingCustomization](/javascript/api/manifest/reportphishingcustomization?view=outlook-js-preview&preserve-view=true) node.
  - A user reports an unsolicited message through the add-in's button in the ribbon. The button shows the preprocessing dialog to the user and activates the [SpamReporting](/javascript/api/office/office.eventtype?view=outlook-js-preview&preserve-view=true) event, which is then handled by the JavaScript event handler. To configure the ribbon button, set the `xsi:type` attribute of the [Control](/javascript/api/manifest/control-button) element to `Button`. Then, set the `xsi:type` attribute of the [Action](/javascript/api/manifest/action) child element to `ExecuteFunction` and specify the name of the spam-reporting event handler in its **\<FunctionName\>** child element. A spam-reporting add-in can only implement [function commands](../design/add-in-commands.md#types-of-add-in-commands).

    :::image type="content" source="../images/outlook-spam-ribbon-button.png" alt-text="A sample ribbon button of a spam-reporting add-in.":::

  - The preprocessing dialog is shown to a user when they report a message. In the dialog, you can share guidance on the reporting process and include options for the user to provide more information about the message being reported. To customize the title, description, and options of the preprocessing dialog, you must include the [PreProcessingDialog](/javascript/api/manifest/preprocessingdialog?view=outlook-js-preview&preserve-view=true) element in your manifest.

## Implement the event handler

When your add-in is used to report a message, it generates a [SpamReporting](/javascript/api/office/office.eventtype?view=outlook-js-preview&preserve-view=true) event, which is then processed by the event handler in the JavaScript file of your add-in. To map the name of the event handler you specified in the **\<FunctionName\>** element of your manifest to its JavaScript counterpart, you must call [Office.actions.associate](/javascript/api/office/office.actions#office-office-actions-associate-member) in your code.

Your event handler is responsible for processing the reported message, such as forwarding a copy of the message to an internal system for further investigation. To efficiently send a copy of the reported message, call the [getAsFileAsync](/javascript/api/outlook/office.messageread?view=outlook-js-preview&preserve-view=true#outlook-office-messageread-getasfileasync-member(1)) method in your event handler. This gets the Base64-encoded EML format of a message, which you can then forward to your internal system.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To test the `getAsFileAsync` method while it's still in preview in Outlook on Windows, you must configure your computer's registry.
>
> Outlook on Windows includes a local copy of the production and beta versions of Office.js instead of loading from the content delivery network (CDN). By default, the local production copy of the API is referenced. To reference the local beta copy of the API, you must configure your computer's registry as follows:
>
> 1. In the registry, navigate to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Outlook\Options\WebExt\Developer`. If the key doesn't exist, create it.
> 1. Create an entry named `EnableBetaAPIsInJavaScript` and set its value to `1`.
>
>    :::image type="content" source="../images/outlook-beta-registry-key.png" alt-text="The EnableBetaAPIsInJavaScript registry value is set to 1.":::

Once the event handler has completed processing the message, it must call the [event.completed](/javascript/api/office/office.addincommands.event#office-office-addincommands-event-completed-member(1)) method. In addition to signaling to the add-in that the spam-reporting event has been processed, `event.completed` can also be used to customize a post-processing dialog to show to the user or perform additional operations on the message, such as deleting it from the inbox. For a list of properties you can include in a JSON object to pass as a parameter to the `event.completed` method, see [Office.AddinCommands.EventCompletedOptions](/javascript/api/office/office.addincommands.eventcompletedoptions).

> [!NOTE]
> Code added after the `event.completed` call isn't guaranteed to run.

The following is an example of a spam-reporting event handler that calls the `getAsFileAsync` method.

1. In your add-in project, navigate to the **./src** directory. Then, create a new folder named **spamreporting**.
1. In the **./src/spamreporting** folder, create a new file named **spamreporting.js**.
1. Open the newly created **spamreporting.js** file and add the following JavaScript code.

    ```javascript
    // Handles the SpamReporting event to process a reported message.
    function onSpamReport(event) {
      // Gets the Base64-encoded EML format of a reported message.
      Office.context.mailbox.item.getAsFileAsync({ asyncContext: event }, (asyncResult) => {
        if (asyncResult.status === Office.AsyncResultStatus.Failed) {
          console.log(`Error encountered during message processing: ${asyncResult.error.message}`);
          return;
        }
    
        // Run additional processing operations here.
    
        /**
         * Signals that the spam-reporting event has completed processing.
         * It then moves the reported message to the Junk Email folder of the mailbox, then
         * shows a post-processing dialog to the user. If an error occurs while the message
         * is being processed, the `onErrorDeleteItem` property determines whether the message
         * will be deleted.
         */
        const event = asyncResult.asyncContext;
        event.completed({
          onErrorDeleteItem: true,
          moveItemTo: Office.MailboxEnums.MoveSpamItemTo.JunkFolder,
          showPostProcessingDialog: {
            title: "Contoso Spam Reporting",
            description: "Thank you for reporting this message.",
          },
        });
      });
    }
    
    // IMPORTANT: To ensure your add-in is supported in the Outlook client on Windows, remember to map the event handler name specified in the manifest to its JavaScript counterpart
    if (Office.context.platform === Office.PlatformType.PC || Office.context.platform == null) {
      Office.actions.associate("onSpamReport", onSpamReport);
    }
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you're on Outlook on Windows Version 2308 (Build 16724.10000) or later, you must use the `moveItemTo` property in the `event.completed` call to specify the folder to which a reported message is moved once it's processed by your add-in. On earlier Outlook builds on Windows that support the integrated spam-reporting feature, you must use the `postProcessingAction` property.

1. Save your changes.

The following is a sample post-processing dialog shown to the user once the add-in completes processing a reported message.

:::image type="content" source="../images/outlook-spam-post-processing-dialog.png" alt-text="A sample of a post-processing dialog shown once a reported spam message has been processed by the add-in.":::

> [!TIP]
> As you develop a spam-reporting add-in that will run in Outlook on Windows, keep the following in mind.
>
> - Imports aren't currently supported in the JavaScript file that contains the code to handle the spam-reporting event.
> - Code included in the `Office.onReady()` and `Office.initialize` functions won't run. You must add any add-in startup logic, such as checking the user's Outlook version, to your event handlers instead.

## Update the commands HTML file

1. In the **./src/commands** folder, open **commands.html**.
1. Immediately before the closing **head** tag (`</head>`), replace the existing script entry with the following code.

    ```html
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://appsforoffice.microsoft.com/lib/beta/hosted/office.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="../spamreporting/spamreporting.js"></script>
    ```

1. Save your changes.

## Update the webpack config settings

1. From the root directory of your add-in project, open the **webpack.config.js** file.

1. Locate the `plugins` array within the `config` object and add this new object to the beginning of the array.

    ```js
    new CopyWebpackPlugin({
      patterns: [
        {
          from: "./src/spamreporting/spamreporting.js",
          to: "spamreporting.js",
        },
      ],
    }),
    ```

1. Save your changes.

## Test and validate your add-in

1. [Sideload](sideload-outlook-add-ins-for-testing.md) the add-in in Outlook on Windows.
1. Choose a message from your inbox, then select the add-in's button from the ribbon.
1. In the preprocessing dialog, choose a reason for reporting the message and add information about the message, if configured. Then, select **Report**.
1. (Optional) In the post-processing dialog, select **OK**.

## Review feature behavior and limitations

As you develop and test the integrated spam-reporting feature in your add-in, be mindful of its characteristics and limitations.

- A spam-reporting add-in can run for a maximum of five minutes once it's activated. Any processing that occurs beyond five minutes will cause the add-in to time out. If the add-in times out, a dialog will be shown to the user to notify them of this.

  :::image type="content" source="../images/outlook-spam-timeout-dialog.png" alt-text="The dialog shown when a spam-reporting add-in times out.":::

- A spam-reporting add-in can be used to report a message even if the Reading Pane of the Outlook client is turned off.
- Only one message can be reported at a time. If a user attempts to report another message while the previous one is still being processed, a dialog will be shown to them to notify them of this.

  :::image type="content" source="../images/outlook-spam-report-error.png" alt-text="The dialog shown when the user attempts to report another message while the previous one is still being processed.":::

- The add-in can still process the reported message even if the user navigates away from the selected message.
- The buttons that appear in the preprocessing and post-processing dialogs aren't customizable. Additionally, the text and buttons in the timeout and ongoing report dialogs can't be modified.
- The integrated spam-reporting and [event-based activation](autolaunch.md) features must use the same runtime. Multiple runtimes aren't currently supported in Outlook. To learn more about runtimes, see [Runtimes in Office Add-ins](../testing/runtimes.md).
