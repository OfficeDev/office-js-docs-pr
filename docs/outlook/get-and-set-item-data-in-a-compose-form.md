# Get and set item data in a compose form in Outlook

Learn how to get or set various properties of an item in an Outlook add-in in a compose scenario, including its recipients, subject, body, and appointment location and time.

## Getting and setting item properties for a compose add-in

In a compose form, you can get most of the properties that are exposed on the same kind of item as in a read form (such as attendees, recipients, subject, and body), and you can get a few extra properties that are relevant in only a compose form but not a read form (body, bcc).

For most of these properties, because it's possible that an Outlook add-in and the user can be modifying the same property in the user interface at the same time, the methods to get and set them are asynchronous. Table 1 lists the item-level properties and corresponding asynchronous methods to get and set them in a compose form. The  [item.itemType](/javascript/api/requirement-sets/outlook/preview-requirement-set/office.context.mailbox.item#properties) and [item.conversationId](/javascript/api/requirement-sets/outlook/preview-requirement-set/office.context.mailbox.item#properties) properties are exceptions because users cannot modify them. You can programmatically get them the same way in a compose form as in a read form, directly from the parent object.

Other than accessing item properties in the Office JavaScript API, you can access item-level properties using Exchange Web Services (EWS). With the **ReadWriteMailbox** permission, you can use the [mailbox.makeEwsRequestAsync](/javascript/api/requirement-sets/outlook/preview-requirement-set/office.context.mailbox#methods) method to access EWS operations, [GetItem](/exchange/client-developer/web-service-reference/getitem-operation) and [UpdateItem](/exchange/client-developer/web-service-reference/updateitem-operation), to get and set more properties of an item or items in the user's mailbox.

The `makeEwsRequestAsync` function is available in both compose and read forms. For more information about the **ReadWriteMailbox** permission, and accessing EWS through the Office Add-ins platform, see [Understanding Outlook add-in permissions](understanding-outlook-add-in-permissions.md) and [Call web services from an Outlook add-in](web-services.md).
