# Debug your event-based Outlook add-in

This article discusses the key debugging stages to enable and set breakpoints in your code as you implement [event-based activation](autolaunch.md) in your add-in. The event-based activation feature was introduced in [requirement set 1.10](/javascript/api/requirement-sets/outlook/requirement-set-1.10/outlook-requirement-set-1.10), with additional events now available in subsequent requirement sets. For more information, see [Supported events](autolaunch.md#supported-events). Before you proceed, review the [event-based troubleshooting guide](autolaunch.md#troubleshooting-guide) for additional guidance.

To begin debugging, select the tab for your applicable client.

# [Windows](#tab/windows)

If you used the [Yeoman generator for Office Add-ins](../develop/yeoman-generator-overview.md) to create your add-in project (for example, by doing the [event-based activation walkthrough](autolaunch.md)), follow the **Created with Yeoman generator** option throughout this article. Otherwise, follow the **Other** steps. Visual Studio Code should be at least version 1.56.1.

## Mark your add-in for debugging

1. Set the registry key `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Wef\Developer\[Add-in ID]\UseDirectDebugger`. Replace `[Add-in ID]` with your add-in's ID from the manifest.

    - **XML manifest**: Use the value of the **\<Id\>** element child of the root **\<OfficeApp\>** element.
    - **Teams manifest (preview)**: Use the value of the "id" property of the root anonymous `{ ... }` object.

    [!include[Developer registry key](../includes/developer-registry-key.md)]

    **Created with Yeoman generator**: In a command line window, navigate to the root of your add-in folder then run the following command.

    ```command&nbsp;line
    npm start
    ```

    In addition to building the code and starting the local server, this command sets the `UseDirectDebugger` registry key for this add-in to `1`.

    **Other**: Add the `UseDirectDebugger` registry key to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\16.0\WEF\Developer\[Add-in ID]\`. Replace `[Add-in ID]` with your add-in's ID from the manifest. Set the registry key to `1`.

1. Start Outlook or restart it if it's already open.
1. Compose a new message or appointment. The Debug Event-based handler dialog should appear. Do *not* interact with the dialog yet.

## Configure Visual Studio Code

### Created with Yeoman generator

1. Back in the command line window, run the following to open your add-in project in Visual Studio Code.

    ```command&nbsp;line
    code .
    ```

1. In Visual Studio Code, open the **./.vscode/launch.json** file and add the following excerpt to your list of configurations. Save your changes.

    ```json
    {
      "name": "Direct Debugging",
      "type": "node",
      "request": "attach",
      "port": 9223,
      "protocol": "inspector",
      "timeout": 600000,
      "trace": true
    }
    ```

### Other

1. Create a new folder called **Debugging** (perhaps in your **Desktop** folder).
1. Open Visual Studio Code.
1. Go to **File** > **Open Folder**, navigate to the folder you just created, then choose **Select Folder**.
1. On the Activity Bar, select **Run and Debug** (Ctrl+Shift+D).

1. Select the **create a launch.json file** link.

    ![The link located under the Run and Debug option to create a launch.json file in Visual Studio Code.](../images/vs-code-create-launch.json.png)

1. In the **Select Environment** dropdown, select **Edge: Launch** to create a launch.json file.
1. Add the following excerpt to your list of configurations. Save your changes.

    ```json
    {
      "name": "Direct Debugging",
      "type": "node",
      "request": "attach",
      "port": 9223,
      "protocol": "inspector",
      "timeout": 600000,
      "trace": true
    }
    ```

## Attach the debugger

1. To find the add-in's **bundle.js** file, navigate to the following folder in File Explorer. Replace text enclosed in `[]` with your applicable Outlook and add-in information.

    ```text
    %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Wef\{[Outlook profile GUID]}\[Outlook mail account encoding]\Javascript\[Add-in ID]_[Add-in Version]_[locale]
    ```

1. Open **bundle.js** in Visual Studio Code.
1. Place breakpoints in **bundle.js** where you want the debugger to stop.
1. In the **DEBUG** dropdown, select **Direct Debugging**, then select the **Start Debugging** icon.

    ![The Direct Debugging option selected from configuration options in the Visual Studio Code Debug dropdown.](../images/outlook-win-autolaunch-debug-vsc.png)

## Run the debugger

1. After confirming that the debugger is attached, return to Outlook, and in the **Debug Event-based handler** dialog, choose **OK** .

1. You can now hit your breakpoints in Visual Studio Code, enabling you to debug your event-based activation code.

## Stop the debugger

To stop debugging the rest of the current Outlook on Windows session, in the **Debug Event-based handler** dialog, choose **Cancel**. To re-enable debugging, restart Outlook.

To prevent the **Debug Event-based handler** dialog from popping up and stop debugging for subsequent Outlook sessions, delete the associated registry key, `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Wef\Developer\[Add-in ID]\UseDirectDebugger`, or set its value to `0`.

# [Mac](#tab/mac)

Event-based add-ins that run in Outlook on Mac use the browser runtime. Because of this, you can debug your add-in using Safari Web Inspector. For further guidance, see [Debug Office Add-ins on a Mac](../testing/debug-office-add-ins-on-ipad-and-mac.md).

# [Web](#tab/web)

Use your preferred browser's developer tools to debug your event-based add-in in Outlook on the web. For more information, see [Debug add-ins in Office on the web](../testing/debug-add-ins-in-office-online.md).
