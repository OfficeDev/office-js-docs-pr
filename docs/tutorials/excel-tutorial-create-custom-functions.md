# Tutorial: Create custom functions in Excel

Custom functions enable you to add new functions to Excel by defining those functions in JavaScript as part of an add-in. Users within Excel can access custom functions as they would any native function in Excel, such as `SUM()`. You can create custom functions that perform simple tasks like calculations or more complex tasks such as streaming real-time data from the web into a worksheet.

In this tutorial, you will:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Create a custom function add-in using the [Yeoman generator for Office Add-ins](../develop/yeoman-generator-overview.md).
> - Use a prebuilt custom function to perform a simple calculation.
> - Create a custom function that gets data from the web.
> - Create a custom function that streams real-time data from the web.

## Prerequisites

[!include[Yeoman generator prerequisites](../includes/quickstart-yo-prerequisites.md)]

- Office connected to a Microsoft 365 subscription (including Office on the web).

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you don't already have Office, you can [join the Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/office/dev-program) to get a free, 90-day renewable Microsoft 365 subscription to use during development.

## Create a custom functions project

 To start, create the code project to build your custom function add-in. The [Yeoman generator for Office Add-ins](../develop/yeoman-generator-overview.md) will set up your project with some prebuilt custom functions that you can try out. If you've already run the custom functions quick start and generated a project, continue to use that project and skip to [this step](#create-a-custom-function-that-requests-data-from-the-web) instead.

> [!NOTE]
> If you recreate the yo office project, you may get an error because the Office cache already has an instance of a function with the same name. You can prevent this by [clearing the Office cache](../testing/clear-cache.md) before running `npm run start`.

1. [!include[Yeoman generator create project guidance](../includes/yo-office-command-guidance.md)]

    - **Choose a project type:** `Excel Custom Functions using a Shared Runtime`
    - **Choose a script type:** `JavaScript`
    - **What do you want to name your add-in?** `My custom functions add-in`

    :::image type="content" source="../images/yo-office-excel-cf-quickstart.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Yeoman Office Add-in generator command line interface prompts for custom functions projects.":::

    The Yeoman generator will create the project files and install supporting Node components.

    [!include[Node.js version 20 warning](../includes/node-20-warning-note.md)]

    [!include[Yeoman generator next steps](../includes/yo-office-next-steps.md)]

1. Navigate to the root folder of the project.

    ```command&nbsp;line
    cd "My custom functions add-in"
    ```

1. Build the project.

    ```command&nbsp;line
    npm run build
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Office Add-ins should use HTTPS, not HTTP, even when you are developing. If you are prompted to install a certificate after you run `npm run build`, accept the prompt to install the certificate that the Yeoman generator provides.

1. Start the local web server, which runs in Node.js. You can try out the custom function add-in in Excel.

# [Excel on Windows or Mac](#tab/excel-windows)

To test your add-in in Excel on Windows or Mac, run the following command. When you run this command, the local web server will start and Excel will open with your add-in loaded.

```command&nbsp;line
npm run start:desktop
```

[!INCLUDE [alert use https](../includes/alert-use-https.md)]

# [Excel on the web](#tab/excel-online)

To test your add-in in Excel on the web, run the following command. When you run this command, the local web server will start. Replace "{url}" with the URL of an Excel document on your OneDrive or a SharePoint library to which you have permissions.

[!INCLUDE [npm start:web command syntax](../includes/start-web-sideload-instructions.md)]

[!INCLUDE [alert use https](../includes/alert-use-https.md)]

## Try out a prebuilt custom function

The custom functions project that you created contains some prebuilt custom functions, defined within the **./src/functions/functions.js** file. The **./manifest.xml** file specifies that all custom functions belong to the `CONTOSO` namespace. You'll use the CONTOSO namespace to access the custom functions in Excel.

Next, try out the `ADD` custom function by completing the following steps.

1. In Excel, go to any cell and enter `=CONTOSO`. Notice that the autocomplete menu shows the list of all functions in the `CONTOSO` namespace.

1. Run the `CONTOSO.ADD` function, with numbers `10` and `200` as input parameters, by typing the value `=CONTOSO.ADD(10,200)` in the cell and pressing enter.

The `ADD` custom function computes the sum of the two numbers that you provided and returns the result of **210**.

> [!NOTE]
> See the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section of this article if you encounter errors when sideloading the add-in.

## Create a custom function that requests data from the web

Integrating data from the Web is a great way to extend Excel through custom functions. Next you'll create a custom function named `getStarCount` that shows how many stars a given Github repository possesses.

1. In the **My custom functions add-in** project, find the file **./src/functions/functions.js** and open it in your code editor.

1. In **function.js**, add the following code.

    ```JS
    /**
      * Gets the star count for a given Github repository.
      * @customfunction 
      * @param {string} userName string name of Github user or organization.
      * @param {string} repoName string name of the Github repository.
      * @return {number} number of stars given to a Github repository.
      */
      async function getStarCount(userName, repoName) {
        try {
          //You can change this URL to any web request you want to work with.
          const url = "https://api.github.com/repos/" + userName + "/" + repoName;
          const response = await fetch(url);
          //Expect that status code is in 200-299 range
          if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error(response.statusText)
          }
            const jsonResponse = await response.json();
            return jsonResponse.watchers_count;
        }
        catch (error) {
          return error;
        }
      }
    ```

1. Run the following command to rebuild the project.

    ```command&nbsp;line
    npm run build
    ```

1. Complete the following steps (for Excel on the web, Windows, or Mac) to re-register the add-in in Excel. You must complete these steps before the new function will be available.

### [Excel on Windows or Mac](#tab/excel-windows)

1. Close Excel and then reopen Excel.

1. In the Excel ribbon, select **Home** > **Add-ins**.

1. Under the **Developer Add-ins** section, select **My custom functions add-in** to register it.

    :::image type="content" source="../images/excel-cf-select-add-in.png" alt-text="The My Add-ins dialog that shows active add-ins, with the My custom function add-in button highlighted.":::

1. Try out the new function. In cell **B1**, type the text **=CONTOSO.GETSTARCOUNT("OfficeDev", "Office-Add-in-Samples")** and press Enter. You should see that the result in cell **B1** is the current number of stars given to the [Office-Add-in-Samples repository](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-Samples).

# [Excel on the web](#tab/excel-online)

1. In Excel, select **Home** > **Add-ins**, then select **More Add-ins**.

1. In the Office Add-ins dialog, choose **Manage My Add-ins**, then select **Upload My Add-in**.

1. Choose **Browse...** and navigate to the root directory of the project that the Yeoman generator created.

1. Select the file **manifest.xml** and choose **Open**, then choose **Upload**.

1. Try out the new function. In cell **B1**, type the text **=CONTOSO.GETSTARCOUNT("OfficeDev", "Excel-Custom-Functions")** and press Enter. You should see that the result in cell **B1** is the current number of stars given to the [Excel-Custom-Functions Github repository](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Excel-Custom-Functions).

> [!NOTE]
> See the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section of this article if you encounter errors when sideloading the add-in.

## Create a streaming asynchronous custom function

The `getStarCount` function returns the number of stars a repository has at a specific moment in time. Custom functions also return data that is continuously changing. These functions are called streaming functions. They must include an `invocation` parameter which refers to the cell that called the function. The `invocation` parameter is used to update the contents of the cell at any time.  

In the following code sample, notice that there are two functions, `currentTime` and `clock`. The `currentTime` function is a static function that doesn't use streaming. It returns the date as a string. The `clock` function uses the `currentTime` function to provide the new time every second to a cell in Excel. It uses `invocation.setResult` to deliver the time to the Excel cell and `invocation.onCanceled` to handle function cancellation. 

The **My custom functions add-in** project already contains the following two functions in the **./src/functions/functions.js** file.

```JS
/**
 * Returns the current time
 * @returns {string} String with the current time formatted for the current locale.
 */
function currentTime() {
  return new Date().toLocaleTimeString();
}
    
/**
 * Displays the current time once a second
 * @customfunction
 * @param {CustomFunctions.StreamingInvocation<string>} invocation Custom function invocation
 */
function clock(invocation) {
  const timer = setInterval(() => {
    const time = currentTime();
    invocation.setResult(time);
  }, 1000);
    
  invocation.onCanceled = () => {
    clearInterval(timer);
  };
}
```

To try out the functions, type the text **=CONTOSO.CLOCK()** in cell **C1** and press enter. You should see the current date, which streams an update every second. While this clock is just a timer on a loop, you can use the same idea of setting a timer on more complex functions that make web requests for real-time data.

## Troubleshooting

You may encounter issues if you run the tutorial multiple times. If the Office cache already has an instance of a function with the same name, your add-in gets an error when it sideloads.

You can prevent this conflict by [clearing the Office cache](../testing/clear-cache.md) before running `npm run start`. If your npm process is already running, enter `npm stop`, clear the Office cache, and then restart npm.
