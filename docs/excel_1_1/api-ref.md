# Office JavaScript API reference

The JavaScript API for Office enables you to create web applications that interact with the object models in Office host applications. 

## Select an Office host and requirement set

Once you've determined the maximum requirement set that your add-in will support, you can filter this API reference documentation such that it only shows the APIs that are available in that requirement set and earlier.

To view API reference documentation for APIs available in a specific requirement set or earlier, select the Office host and requirement set from the list that appears above the table of contents and filter box on the left side of the page.

For example, if `Excel JavaScript API 1.4` is selected (as shown in the following screenshot), the **API reference** section of the documentation will contain only information about Excel JavaScript APIs that are available in that requirement set or earlier, as well as information about the Common APIs (which you can use in any Office add-in).
