# Best practices for developing Office Add-ins

Effective add-ins offer unique and compelling functionality that extends Office applications in a visually appealing way. To create a great add-in, provide an engaging first-time experience for your users, design a first-class UI experience, and optimize your add-in's performance. Apply the best practices described in this article to create add-ins that help your users complete their tasks quickly and efficiently.

> [!NOTE]
> If you plan to [publish](../publish/publish.md) your add-in to AppSource and make it available within the Office experience, make sure that you conform to the [AppSource validation policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/store/validation-policies).Â For example, to pass validation, your add-in must work across all platforms that support the methods that you define (for more information, see [section 4.12](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/store/validation-policies#4-apps-and-add-ins-behave-predictably) and the [Office Add-in host and availability page](../overview/office-add-in-availability.md)). 

## Provide clear value

- Create add-ins that help users complete tasks quickly and efficiently. Focus on scenarios that make sense for Office applications. For example:
 - Make core authoring tasks faster and easier, with fewer interruptions.
 - Enable new scenarios within Office.
 - Embed complementary services within Office hosts.
 - Improve the Office experience to enhance productivity.
- Make sure that the value of your add-in is clear to users right away by [creating an engaging first run experience](#create-an-engaging-first-run-experience).
- Create an [effective AppSource listing](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/store/create-effective-office-store-listings). Make the benefits of your add-in clear in your title and description. Don't rely on your brand to communicate what your add-in does.


## Create an engaging first-run experience

- Engage new users with a highly usable and intuitive first experience. Note that users are still deciding whether to use or abandon an add-in after they download it from the store.

- Make the steps that the user needs to take to engage with your add-in clear. Use videos, placemats, paging panels, or other resources to entice users.

- Reinforce the value proposition of your add-in on launch, rather than just asking users to sign in.

- Provide teaching UI to guide users and make your UI personal.

- If your content add-in binds to data in the user's document, include sample data or a template to show users the data format to use.

- Offer [free trials](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/store/decide-on-a-pricing-model#office-store-pricing-options). If your add-in requires a subscription, make some functionality available without a subscription.

- Make signup simple. Prefill information (email, display name) and skip email verifications.

- Avoid pop ups. If you have to use them, guide the user to enable your pop up.

- Use [single sign-on (SSO) authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/outlook/add-ins/authenticate-a-user-with-an-identity-token).

For templates that illustrate patterns that you can apply as you develop your first-run experience, see [UX design patterns for Office Add-ins](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-UX-Design-Patterns-Code).

## Use add-in commands

- Provide relevant UI entry points for your add-in by using add-in commands. For details, including design best practices, see [add-in commands](../design/add-in-commands.md).

## Apply UX design principles

- Ensure that the look and feel and functionality of your add-in complements the Office experience. Use [Office UI Fabric](https://developer.microsoft.com/fabric).

- Favor content over chrome. Avoid superfluous UI elements that don't add value to the user experience.

- Keep users in control. Ensure that users understand important decisions, and can easily reverse actions the add-in performs.

- Use branding to inspire trust and orient users. Do not use branding to overwhelm or advertise to users.

- Avoid scrolling. Optimize for 1366 x 768 resolution.

- Do not include unlicensed images.

- Use [clear and simple language](../design/voice-guidelines.md) in your add-in.

- Account for accessibility - make your add-in easy for all users to interact with, and accommodate assistive technologies such as screen readers.

- Design for all platforms and input methods, including mouse/keyboard and [touch](#optimize-for-touch). Ensure that your UI is responsive to different form factors.

For templates that apply design principles that you can use and customize as you develop your add-in, see [UX design patterns for Office Add-ins](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-UX-Design-Patterns-Code).

### Optimize for touch

- Use the [Context.touchEnabled](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/office/office.context?view=office-js) property to detect whether the host application your add-in runs on is touch enabled.

  > [!NOTE]
  > This property is not supported in Outlook.

- Ensure that all controls are appropriately sized for touch interaction. For example, buttons have adequate touch targets, and input boxes are large enough for users to enter input.

- Do not rely on non-touch input methods like hover or right-click.

- Ensure that your add-in works in both portrait and landscape modes. Be aware that on touch devices, part of your add-in might be hidden by the soft keyboard.

- Test your add-in on a real device by using [sideloading](../testing/sideload-an-office-add-in-on-ipad-and-mac.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using [Office UI Fabric](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-UI-Fabric) for your design elements, many of these elements are taken care of.


## Optimize and monitor add-in performance

- Create the perception of fast UI responses. Your add-in should load in 500 ms or less.

- Ensure that all user interactions respond in under one second.

-  Provide loading indicators for long-running operations.

- Use a CDN to host images, resources, and common libraries. Load as much as you can from one place.

- Follow standard web practices to optimize your web page. In production, use only minified versions of libraries. Only load resources that you need, and optimize how resources are loaded.

- If operations take time to execute, provide feedback to users. Note the thresholds listed in the following table. For additional information, see [Resource limits and performance optimization for Office Add-ins](../concepts/resource-limits-and-performance-optimization.md).

  |**Interaction class**|**Target**|**Upper bound**|**Human perception**|
  |:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
  |Instant|<=50 ms|100 ms|No noticeable delay.|
  |Fast|50-100 ms|200 ms|Minimally noticeable delay. No feedback necessary.|
  |Typical|100-300 ms|500 ms|Quick, but too slow to be described as fast. No feedback necessary.|
  |Responsive|300-500 ms|1 second|Not fast, but still feels responsive. No feedback necessary.|
  |Continuous|>500 ms|5 seconds|Medium wait, no longer feels responsive. Might need feedback.|
  |Captive|>500 ms|10 seconds|Long, but not long enough to do something else. Might need feedback.|
  |Extended|>500 ms|>10 seconds|Long enough to do something else while waiting. Might need feedback.|
  |Long running|>5 seconds|>1 minute|Users will certainly do something else.|

- Monitor your service health, and use telemetry to monitor user success.


## Market your add-in

- Publish your add-in to [AppSource](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/store/submit-to-the-office-store) and [promote it](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/store/promote-your-office-store-solution) from your website. Create an [effective AppSource listing](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/store/create-effective-office-store-listings).

- Use succinct and descriptive add-in titles. Include no more than 128 characters.

- Write short, compelling descriptions of your add-in. Answer the question "What problem does this add-in solve?".

- Convey the value proposition of your add-in in your title and description. Don't rely on your brand.

- Create a website to help users find and use your add-in.
