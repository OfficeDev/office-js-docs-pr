# Publish task pane and content add-ins to a SharePoint app catalog

An app catalog is a dedicated site collection in a SharePoint web application or SharePoint Online tenancy that hosts document libraries for Office and SharePoint Add-ins. To make Office Add-ins accessible to users within their organization, administrators can upload Office Add-ins manifest files to the app catalog for their organization. When an administrator registers an app catalog as a trusted catalog, users can insert the add-in from the insertion UI in an Office client application.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - App catalogs on SharePoint do not support add-in features that are implemented in the `VersionOverrides` node of the [add-in manifest](../develop/add-in-manifests.md), such as add-in commands.
> - If youâ€™re targeting a cloud or hybrid environment, we recommend that you [use Centralized Deployment via the Office 365 admin center](../publish/centralized-deployment.md) to publish your add-ins.
> - App catalogs on SharePoint are not supported in Office on Mac. To deploy Office Add-ins to Mac clients, you must submit them to [AppSource](/office/dev/store/submit-to-the-office-store).

## Create an app catalog

Complete the steps in one of the following sections to create an app catalog with on-premises SharePoint Server or on Office 365.

### To create an app catalog for on-premises SharePoint Server

To create the SharePoint app catalog, follow the instructions at [Configure the App Catalog site for a web application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/administration/manage-the-app-catalog).

Once you have created the app catalog follow the steps to [publish an Office Add-in](#publish-an-office-add-in).

### To create an app catalog on Office 365

1. Go to the Microsoft 365 admin center. For information on how to find the admin center, see [About the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/admin-overview/about-the-admin-center).

2. On the Microsoft 365 admin center page, expand the list of **Admin centers**, and then choose **SharePoint**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You need to use the Classic SharePoint admin center to create the catalog. If you are in the new SharePoint admin center, choose **Classic SharePoint admin center** in the left pane.

3. In the left task pane, choose  **apps**.

4. On the **apps** page, choose **App Catalog**.
    > [!NOTE]

7. Specify the **Web Site Address**.

For online Office applications, you can find Office Add-ins from the app catalog by completing the following steps.
