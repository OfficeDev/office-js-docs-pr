# Publish task pane and content add-ins to a SharePoint catalog

An add-in catalog is a dedicated site collection in a SharePoint web application or SharePoint Online tenancy that hosts document libraries for Office and SharePoint Add-ins. To make Office Add-ins accessible to users within their organization, administrators can upload Office Add-ins manifest files to the add-in catalog for their organization. When an administrator registers an add-in catalog as a trusted catalog, users can insert the add-in from the insertion UI in an Office client application.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Add-in catalogs on SharePoint do not support add-in features that are implemented in the `VersionOverrides` node of the [add-in manifest](../develop/add-in-manifests.md), such as add-in commands.
> - If youâ€™re targeting a cloud or hybrid environment, we recommend that you [use Centralized Deployment via the Office 365 admin center](../publish/centralized-deployment.md) to publish your add-ins.
> - SharePoint catalogs are not supported for Office for Mac. To deploy Office Add-ins to Mac clients, you must submit them to [AppSource](/office/dev/store/submit-to-the-office-store).   

## Create an add-in catalog

Complete the steps in one of the following sections to create an add-in catalog on SharePoint or on Office 365.

### To create an add-in catalog for on-premises SharePoint

> [!NOTE]
> The UI in on-premises SharePoint still refers to add-ins as **apps**.

1. Browse to the  **Central Administration Site**.

2. In the left task pane, choose  **Apps**.

3. On the  **Apps** page, under **App Management**, choose  **Manage App Catalog**.

4. On the  **Manage App Catalog** page, make sure you have the right web application selected in the **Web Application Selector**.

5. Choose  **View site settings**.

6. On the  **Site Settings** page, choose **Site collection administrators** to specify the site collection administrators, and then choose **OK**.

7. To grant site permissions to users, choose  **Site Permissions**, and then choose  **Grant Permissions**.

8. In the  **Share 'App Catalog Site'** dialog box, specify one or more site users, set the appropriate permissions for them, optionally set other options, and then choose **Share**.

9. To add an add-in to the Office Add-ins add-in catalog, choose **Apps for Office**.

### To create an app catalog on Office 365

Even though SharePoint names the catalog an "app" catalog, you can register Office Add-ins in the app catalog.

1. Go to the Microsoft 365 admin center. For information on how to find the admin center, see [About the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/admin-overview/about-the-admin-center).

2. On the Microsoft 365 admin center page, expand the list of **Admin centers**, and then choose **SharePoint**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You need to use the Classic SharePoint admin center to create the catalog. If you are in the new SharePoint admin center, choose **Classic SharePoint admin center** in the left pane.

3. In the left task pane, choose  **apps**.

4. On the **apps** page, choose **App Catalog**.
    > [!NOTE]
    > If an app catalog is already created and appears on this page, then you can skip the rest of these steps and go to the next section of this article to publish your add-in to the catalog.

5. On the **App Catalog Site** page, choose **OK** to accept the default option and create a new add-in catalog site.

6. On the **Create App Catalog Site Collection** page, specify the title of your App Catalog site.

7. Specify the **Web Site Address**.

8. Specify an **Administrator**.

9. Set the **Server Resource Quota** to 0 (zero). (The server resource quota is related to throttling poorly performing sandboxed solutions, but you won't be installing any sandboxed solutions on your app catalog site.)

10. Choose **OK**.

The app catalog is now created.

## Publish an add-in to an app catalog

To publish an add-in to an existing app catalog, complete the following steps.

1. Go to the Microsoft 365 admin center. For information on how to find the admin center, see [About the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/admin-overview/about-the-admin-center).
2. On the Microsoft 365 admin center page, expand the list of **Admin centers**, and then choose **SharePoint**.
    > [!NOTE]
    > You need to use the Classic SharePoint admin center to create the catalog. If you are in the new SharePoint admin center, choose **Classic SharePoint admin center** in the left pane.
3. In the left task pane, choose  **apps**.
4. On the **apps** page, choose **App Catalog**.
5. Choose **Distribute apps for Office**.
6. In the **Apps for Office** page, choose **New**.
7. In the **Add a document** dialog, select the **Choose Files** button.
8. Locate and specify the [manifest](../develop/add-in-manifests.md) file to upload and choose **Open**.
9. In the **Add a document** dialog, choose **OK**.

    Content and task pane add-ins in this catalog are now available from the  **Office Add-ins** dialog box. To access them, choose **My Add-ins** on the **Insert** tab, and then choose **MY ORGANIZATION**.

## End user experience with the add-in catalog

End users can access the add-in catalog in an Office application by completing the following steps:

1. In the Office application, go to  **File** > **Options** > **Trust Center** > **Trust Center Settings** > **Trusted Add-in Catalogs**.

2. Specify the URL of the  _parent SharePoint site collection_ of the add-in catalog. 

    For example, if the URL of the Office Add-ins catalog is:

    - `https:// _domain_ /sites/ _AddinCatalogSiteCollection_ /AgaveCatalog`

    Specify just the URL of the parent site collection:

    - `https:// _domain_ /sites/ _AddinCatalogSiteCollection_`

3. Close and reopen the Office application. The add-in catalog will be available in the **Office Add-ins** dialog box.

Alternatively, an administrator can specify an Office Add-in catalog on SharePoint by using group policy. For details, see the section [Using Group Policy to manage how users can install and use Office Add-ins](/previous-versions/office/office-2013-resource-kit/jj219429(v=office.15)#using-group-policy-to-manage-how-users-can-install-and-use-apps-for-office).
