# Publish task pane and content add-ins to a SharePoint app catalog

An app catalog is a dedicated site collection in a SharePoint web application or SharePoint Online tenancy that hosts document libraries for Office and SharePoint Add-ins. To make Office Add-ins accessible to users within their organization, administrators can upload Office Add-ins manifest files to the app catalog for their organization. When an administrator registers an app catalog as a trusted catalog, users can insert the add-in from the insertion UI in an Office client application.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - App catalogs on SharePoint do not support add-in features that are implemented in the `VersionOverrides` node of the [add-in manifest](../develop/add-in-manifests.md), such as add-in commands.
> - If youâ€™re targeting a cloud or hybrid environment, we recommend that you [use Centralized Deployment via the Microsoft 365 admin center](../publish/centralized-deployment.md) to publish your add-ins.
> - App catalogs on SharePoint are not supported in Office on Mac. To deploy Office Add-ins to Mac clients, you must submit them to [AppSource](/office/dev/store/submit-to-the-office-store).
