# Work with OneNote page content 

In the OneNote add-ins JavaScript API, page content is represented by the following object model.

  ![OneNote page object model diagram](../images/one-note-om-page.png)

- A Page object contains a collection of PageContent objects.
- A PageContent object contains a content type of Outline, Image, or Other.
- An Outline object contains a collection of Paragraph objects.
- A Paragraph object contains a content type of RichText, Image, Table, or Other.

To create an empty OneNote page, use one of the following methods:

- [Section.addPage](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/onenote/onenote.section?view=office-js#addpage-title-)
- [Page.insertPageAsSibling](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/onenote/onenote.section?view=office-js#insertsectionassibling-location--title-)

Then use methods in the following objects to work with the page content, such as Page.addOutline and Outline.appendHtml. 

- [Page](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/onenote/onenote.page?view=office-js)
- [Outline](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/onenote/onenote.outline?view=office-js)
- [Paragraph](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/onenote/onenote.paragraph?view=office-js)

The content and structure of a OneNote page are represented by HTML. Only a subset of HTML is supported for creating or updating page content, as described below.

## Supported HTML

The OneNote add-in JavaScript API supports the following HTML for creating and updating page content:

- `<html>`, `<body>`, `<div>`, `<span>`, `<br/>` 
- `<p>`
- `<img>`
- `<a>`
- `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>` 
- `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`
- `<h1>` ... `<h6>`
- `<b>`, `<em>`, `<strong>`, `<i>`, `<u>`, `<del>`, `<sup>`, `<sub>`, `<cite>`

## Accessing page contents

You are only able to access *Page Content* via `Page#load` for the currently
active page. To change the active  page, invoke `navigateToPage($page)`.

Metadata such as title can still be queried for any page.
