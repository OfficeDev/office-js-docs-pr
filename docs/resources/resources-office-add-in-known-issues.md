### Outlook: Delays loading inline images in email signatures in the new Outlook for Windows and Outlook for the web

#### ISSUE

We're currently investigating reports from Outlook users who are experiencing loading delays of inline images in email signatures when using the new Outlook for Windows and Outlook for the web. Our findings indicate that this is a server-side performance issue that affects rendering of all inline images. Attempting to send messages while the images are not yet loaded results in the following dialog box.

#### WORKAROUND

1. Remove inline images from signature.
1. Wait for images to load before sending the file.
