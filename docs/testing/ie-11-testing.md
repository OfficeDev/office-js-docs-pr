# Test your Office Add-in on Internet Explorer 11

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Internet Explorer still used in Office Add-ins**
>
> Some combinations of platforms and Office versions, including one-time-purchase versions through Office 2019, still use the webview control that comes with Internet Explorer 11 to host add-ins, as explained in [Browsers used by Office Add-ins](../concepts/browsers-used-by-office-web-add-ins.md). We recommend (but don't require) that you continue to support these combinations, at least in a minimal way, by providing users of your add-in a graceful failure message when your add-in is launched in the Internet Explorer webview. Keep these additional points in mind:
>
> - Office on the web no longer opens in Internet Explorer. Consequently, [AppSource](/office/dev/store/submit-to-appsource-via-partner-center) no longer tests add-ins in Office on the web using Internet Explorer as the browser.
> - AppSource still tests for combinations of platform and Office *desktop* versions that use Internet Explorer, however it only issues a warning when the add-in does not support Internet Explorer; the add-in is not rejected by AppSource.
> - The [Script Lab tool](../overview/explore-with-script-lab.md) no longer supports Internet Explorer.

If you plan to support older versions of Windows and Office, your add-in must work in the embeddable browser control that is based on Internet Explorer 11 (IE11). You can use a command line to switch from more modern runtimes used by add-ins to the Internet Explorer 11 runtime for this testing. For information about which versions of Windows and Office use the Internet Explorer 11 web view control, see [Browsers used by Office Add-ins](../concepts/browsers-used-by-office-web-add-ins.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Internet Explorer 11 does not support JavaScript versions later than ES5. If you want to use the syntax and features of ECMAScript 2015 or later, you have two options:
>
> - Write your code in ECMAScript 2015 (also called ES6) or later JavaScript, or in TypeScript, and then compile your code to ES5 JavaScript using a compiler such as [babel](https://babeljs.io/) or [tsc](https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html).
> - Write in ECMAScript 2015 or later JavaScript, but also load a [polyfill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill_(programming)) library such as [core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) that enables IE to run your code.
>
> For more information about these options, see [Support Internet Explorer 11](../develop/support-ie-11.md).
>
> Also, Internet Explorer 11 does not support some HTML5 features such as media, recording, and location. To learn more, see [Determine at runtime if the add-in is running in Internet Explorer](../develop/support-ie-11.md#determine-at-runtime-if-the-add-in-is-running-in-internet-explorer).

> [!NOTE]
> - Office on the web cannot be opened in Internet Explorer 11, so you cannot (and do not need to) test your add-in on Office on the web with Internet Explorer.
>
> - Internet Explorer's Enhanced Security Configuration (ESC) must be turned off for Office Web Add-ins to work. If you are using a Windows Server computer as your client when developing add-ins, note that ESC is turned on by default in Windows Server.

## Switch to the Internet Explorer 11 webview

> [!TIP]
> [!INCLUDE[Identify the webview through the add-in UI](../includes/identify-webview-in-ui.md)]

There are two ways to switch the Internet Explorer webview. You can run a simple command in a command prompt, or you can install a version of Office that uses Internet Explorer by default. We recommend the first method. But you should use the second in the following scenarios.

- Your project was developed with Visual Studio and IIS. It isn't node.js-based.
- You want to be absolutely robust in your testing.
- If for any reason the command line tool doesn't work.

### Switch via the command line

### Install a version of Office that uses Internet Explorer
