# Validate an Office Add-in's manifest

You should validate your add-in's manifest file to ensure that it's correct and complete. Validation can also identify issues that are causing the error "Your add-in manifest is not valid" when you attempt to sideload your add-in. This article describes multiple ways to validate the manifest file. Except as specified otherwise, they work for both the unified manifest for Microsoft 365 and the add-in only manifest.

> [!NOTE]
> For details about using runtime logging to troubleshoot issues with your add-in's manifest, see [Debug your add-in with runtime logging](runtime-logging.md).

## Validate your manifest with the validate command

If you used the [Teams Toolkit](../develop/teams-toolkit-overview.md) or [Yeoman generator for Office Add-ins](../develop/yeoman-generator-overview.md) to create your add-in, you can validate your project's manifest file with the following command in the root directory of your project.

```command&nbsp;line
npm run validate
```

[!INCLUDE [validate also runs Microsoft 365 and Copilot store validation](../includes/office-store-validate.md)]

If you're having trouble with that command, try the following (replacing `MANIFEST_FILE` with the name of the manifest file).

```command&nbsp;line
npx office-addin-manifest validate -p MANIFEST_FILE
```

## Validate your manifest with office-addin-manifest

If you didn't use the [Teams Toolkit](../develop/teams-toolkit-overview.md) or [Yeoman generator for Office Add-ins](../develop/yeoman-generator-overview.md) to create your add-in, you can validate the manifest by using [office-addin-manifest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/office-addin-manifest).

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/).

1. Open a command prompt and install the validator with the following command.

    ```command&nbsp;line
    npm install -g office-addin-manifest
    ```

1. Run the following command *in the folder of your project that contains the manifest file* (replacing `MANIFEST_FILE` with the name of the manifest file).

    ```command&nbsp;line
    office-addin-manifest validate MANIFEST_FILE
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If this command isn't working, run the following command instead to force the use of the latest version of the office-addin-manifest tool (replacing `MANIFEST_FILE` with the name of the manifest file).
    >
    > ```command&nbsp;line
    > npx office-addin-manifest validate MANIFEST_FILE
    > ```

## Validate the manifest in the UI of Teams Toolkit

If you're working in Teams Toolkit and using the unified manifest, you can use the toolkit's validation options. For instructions, see [Validate application](/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/teamsfx-preview-and-customize-app-manifest#validate-application).
