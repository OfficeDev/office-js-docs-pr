# Sideload Outlook add-ins for testing

You can use sideloading to install an Outlook add-in for testing without having to first put it in an add-in catalog.

 >**Note**  You can also sideload add-ins for other Office suite applications. For more information, see [Sideload Office Add-ins for testing](sideload-office-add-ins-for-testing.md).


## Sideloading Outlook add-ins


1. Go to [Outlook Web App](https://outlook.office365.com).
    
2. Choose the gear icon in the top-right section and select  **Manage add-ins**.

4. Locate the manifest file for your custom add-in and install it. Accept all prompts during the installation.
    
When that's done, select an existing email and you will see a horizontal bar below the email header that includes the add-in. Next, create an email, and then choose the  **Add-ins** (or **Apps**) menu item to get the task pane to appear. Select the add-in and see it appear in the task pane.
