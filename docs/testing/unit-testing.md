# Unit testing in Office Add-ins

Unit tests check your add-in's functionality without requiring network or service connections, including connections to the Office application. Unit testing server-side code, and client-side code that does *not* call the [Office JavaScript APIs](../develop/understanding-the-javascript-api-for-office.md), is the same in Office Add-ins as it is in any web application, so it requires no special documentation. But client-side code that calls the Office JavaScript APIs is challenging to test. To solve these problems, we have created a library to simplify the creation of mock Office objects in unit tests: [Office-Addin-Mock](https://www.npmjs.com/package/office-addin-mock). The library makes testing easier in the following ways:

- The Office JavaScript APIs must initialize in a webview control in the context of an Office application (Excel, Word, etc.), so they cannot be loaded in the process in which unit tests run on your development computer. The Office-Addin-Mock library can be imported into your test files, which enables the mocking of Office JavaScript APIs inside the node.js process in which the tests run.
- The [application-specific APIs](../develop/understanding-the-javascript-api-for-office.md#api-models) have [load](../develop/application-specific-api-model.md#load) and [sync](../develop/application-specific-api-model.md#sync) methods that must be called in a particular order relative to other functions and to each other. Moreover, the `load` method must be called with certain parameters depending on what what properties of Office objects are going to be read in by code *later* in the function being tested. But unit testing frameworks are inherently stateless, so they cannot keep a record of whether `load` or `sync` was called or what parameters were passed to `load`. The mock objects that you create with the Office-Addin-Mock library have internal state that keeps track of these things. This enables the mock objects to emulate the error behavior of actual Office objects. For example, if the function that is being tested tries to read a property that was not first passed to `load`, then the test will return an error similar to what Office would return.

The library doesn't depend on the Office JavaScript APIs and it can be used with any JavaScript unit testing framework, such as:

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io)
- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/workflows/unit-testing)
- [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/)

The examples in this article use the Jest framework. There are examples using the Mocha framework at [the Office-Addin-Mock home page](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Addin-Scripts/tree/master/packages/office-addin-mock#examples).

## Prerequisites

This article assumes that you are familiar with the basic concepts of unit testing and mocking, including how to create and run test files, and that you have some experience with a unit testing framework.

> [!TIP]
> If you are working with Visual Studio, we recommend that you read the article [Unit testing JavaScript and TypeScript in Visual Studio](/visualstudio/javascript/unit-testing-javascript-with-visual-studio.md) for some basic information about JavaScript unit testing in Visual Studio and then return to this article.

## Install the tool

To install the library, open a command prompt, navigate to the root of your add-in project, and then enter the following command.

```command&nbsp;line
npm install office-addin-mock --save-dev
```

## Basic usage

1. Your project will have one or more test files. (See the instructions for your test framework and the example test files in Examples(#examples) below.) Import the library, with either the `require` or `import` keyword, to any test file that has a test of a function that calls the Office JavaScript APIs, as shown in the following example.

   ```javascript
   const OfficeAddinMock = require("office-addin-mock");
   ```

1. Import the module that contains the add-in function that you want to test with either the `require` or `import` keyword. The following is an example that assumes your test file is in a subfolder of the folder with your add-in's code files.

   ```javascript
   const myOfficeAddinFeature = require("../my-office-add-in");
   ```

1. Create a data object that has the properties and subproperties that you need to mock to test the function. The following is an example of an object that mocks the Excel [Workbook.range.address](/javascript/api/excel/excel.range#address) property and the [Workbook.getSelectedRange](/javascript/api/excel/excel.workbook#getSelectedRange__) method. This isn't the final mock object. Think of it as a seed object that is used by `OfficeMockObject` to create the final mock object.

   ```javascript
   const mockData = {
     workbook: {
       range: {
         address: "C2:G3",
       },
       getSelectedRange: function () {
         return this.range;
       },
     },
   };
   ```

1. Pass the data object to the `OfficeMockObject` constructor. Note the following about the returned `OfficeMockObject` object.

   - It is a simplified mock of an [OfficeExtension.ClientRequestContext](/javascript/api/office/officeextension.clientrequestcontext) object.
   - The mock object has all the members of the data object and also has mock implementations of the `load` and `sync` methods.
   - The mock object will mimic crucial error behavior of the `ClientRequestContext` object. For example, if the Office API you are testing tries to read a property without first loading the property and calling `sync`, then the test will fail with an error similar to what would be thrown in production runtime: "Error, property not loaded".

   ```javascript
   const contextMock = new OfficeAddinMock.OfficeMockObject(mockData);
   ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Full reference documentation for the `OfficeMockObject` type is at [Office-Addin-Mock](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Addin-Scripts/tree/master/packages/office-addin-mock#reference).

1. In the syntax of your test framework, add a test of the function. Use the `OfficeMockObject` object in place of the object that it mocks, in this case the `ClientRequestContext` object. The following continues the example in Jest. This example test assumes that the add-in function that is being tested is called `getSelectedRangeAddress`, that it takes a `ClientRequestContext` object as a parameter, and that it is intended to return the address of the currently selected range. The full example is [later in this article](#mocking-a-clientrequestcontext-object).

   ```javascript
   test("getSelectedRangeAddress should return the address of the range", async function () {
     expect(await getSelectedRangeAddress(contextMock)).toBe("C2:G3");
   });
   ```

1. Run the test in accordance with documentation of the test framework and your development tools. Typically, there is a **package.json** file with a script that executes the test framework. For example, if Jest is the framework, **package.json** would contain the following:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "test": "jest",
     -- other scripts omitted --  
   }
   ```

   To run the test, enter the following in a command prompt in the root of the project.

   ```command&nbsp;line
   npm test
   ```

## Examples

The examples in this section use Jest with its default settings. These settings support CommonJS modules. See the [Jest documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) for how to configure Jest and node.js to support ECMAScript modules and to support TypeScript. To run any of these examples, take the following steps.

> [!NOTE]
> 

1. Create an Office add-in project for the appropriate Office host application (for example, Excel or Word). One way to do this quickly is to use the [Yo Office tool](https://github.com/OfficeDev/generator-office).
1. In the root of the project, [install Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started).
1. [Install the office-addin-mock tool](#install-the-tool).
1. Create a file exactly like the first file in the example and add it to the folder that contains the project's other source files, often called `\src`.
1. Create a subfolder to the source file folder and give it an appropriate name, such as `\tests`.
1. Create a file exactly like the test file in the example and add it to the subfolder.
1. Add a `test` script to the **package.json** file, and then run the test, as described in [Basic usage](#basic-usage).

### Mocking the Office Common APIs

This example assumes an Office Add-in for any host that supports the [Office Common APIs](../develop/office-javascript-api-object-model.md) (for example, Excel, PowerPoint, or Word). The add-in has one of its features in a file named `my-common-api-add-in-feature.js`. The following shows the contents of the file. The `addHelloWorldText` function sets the text "Hello World!" to whatever is currently selected in the document; for example; a range in Word, or a cell in Excel, or a text box in PowerPoint.

```javascript
const myCommonAPIAddinFeature = {

    addHelloWorldText: async () => {
        const options = { coercionType: Office.CoercionType.Text };
        await Office.context.document.setSelectedDataAsync("Hello World!", options);
    }
}
  
module.exports = myCommonAPIAddinFeature;
```

The test file, named `my-common-api-add-in-feature.test.js` is in a subfolder, relative to the location of the add-in code file. The following shows the contents of the file. Note that the top level property is `context`, an [Office.Context](/javascript/api/office/office.context) object, so the object that is being mocked is the parent of this property: an [Office](/javascript/api/office) object. Note the following about this code:

- The `OfficeMockObject` constructor does *not* add all of the Office enum classes to the mock `Office` object, so the `CoercionType.Text` value that is referenced in the add-in method must be added explicitly in the seed object.
- Because the Office JavaScript library isn't loaded in the node process, the `Office` object that is referenced in the add-in code must be declared and initialized.

```javascript
const OfficeAddinMock = require("office-addin-mock");
const myCommonAPIAddinFeature = require("../my-common-api-add-in-feature");

// Create the seed mock object.
const mockData = {
    context: {
      document: {
        setSelectedDataAsync: function (data, options) {
          this.data = data;
          this.options = options;
        },
      },
    },
    // Mock the Office.CoercionType enum.
    CoercionType: {
      Text: {},
    },
};
  
// Create the final mock object from the seed object.
const officeMock = new OfficeAddinMock.OfficeMockObject(mockData);

// Create the Office object that is called in the addHelloWorldText function.
global.Office = officeMock;

/* Code that calls the test framework goes below this line. */

// Jest test
test("Text of selection in document should be set to 'Hello World'", async function () {
    await myCommonAPIAddinFeature.addHelloWorldText();
    expect(officeMock.context.document.data).toBe("Hello World!");
});
```

### Mocking the Outlook APIs

Although strictly speaking, the Outlook APIs are part of the Common API model, they have a special architecture that is built around the [Mailbox](/javascript/api/office/office.mailbox) object, so we have provided a distinct example for Outlook. This example assumes an Outlook that has one of its features in a file named `my-outlook-add-in-feature.js`. The following shows the contents of the file. The `addHelloWorldText` function sets the text "Hello World!" to whatever is currently selected in the message compose window.

```javascript
const myOutlookAddinFeature = {

    addHelloWorldText: async () => {
        Office.context.mailbox.item.setSelectedDataAsync("Hello World!");
      }
}

module.exports = myOutlookAddinFeature;
```

The test file, named `my-outlook-add-in-feature.test.js` is in a subfolder, relative to the location of the add-in code file. The following shows the contents of the file. Note that the top level property is `context`, an [Office.Context](/javascript/api/office/office.context) object, so the object that is being mocked is the parent of this property: an [Office](/javascript/api/office) object. Note the following about this code:

- Because the Office JavaScript library isn't loaded in the node process, the `Office` object that is referenced in the add-in code must be declared and initialized.

```javascript
const OfficeAddinMock = require("office-addin-mock");
const myOutlookAddinFeature = require("../my-outlook-add-in-feature");

// Create the seed mock object.
const mockData = {
  context: {
    mailbox: {
      item: {
          setSelectedDataAsync: function (data) {
          this.data = data;
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
  
// Create the final mock object from the seed object.
const officeMock = new OfficeAddinMock.OfficeMockObject(mockData);

// Create the Office object that is called in the addHelloWorldText function.
global.Office = officeMock;

/* Code that calls the test framework goes below this line. */

// Jest test
test("Text of selection in message should be set to 'Hello World'", async function () {
    await myOutlookAddinFeature.addHelloWorldText();
    expect(officeMock.context.mailbox.item.data).toBe("Hello World!");
});
```

### Mocking the Office application-specific APIs

When you are testing functions that use the application-specific APIs, be sure that you are mocking the right type of object. There are two options:

- Mock a [OfficeExtension.ClientRequestObject](/javascript/api/office/officeextension.clientrequestcontext). Do this when the function that is being tested meets both of the following conditions:

  - It doesn't call a *Host*.`run` method, such as [Excel.run](/javascript/api/excel#Excel_run_batch_).
  - It doesn't reference any other direct property or method of a *Host* object.

- Mock a *Host* object, such as [Excel](/javascript/api/excel) or [Word](/javascript/api/word). Do this when the preceding option isn't possible.

Examples of both types of tests are in the subsections below.

#### Mocking a ClientRequestContext object

This example assumes an Excel add-in that has one of its features in a file named `my-excel-add-in-feature.js`. The following shows the contents of the file. Note that the `getSelectedRangeAddress` is a helper method called inside the callback that is passed to `Excel.run`.

```javascript
const myExcelAddinFeature = {
    
    getSelectedRangeAddress: async (context) => {
        const range = context.workbook.getSelectedRange();      
        range.load("address");

        await context.sync();
      
        return range.address;
    }
}

module.exports = myExcelAddinFeature;
```

The test file, named `my-excel-add-in-feature.test.js` is in a subfolder, relative to the location of the add-in code file. The following shows the contents of the file. Note that the top level property is `workbook`, so the object that is being mocked is the parent of an `Excel.Workbook`: a `ClientRequestContext` object.

```javascript
const OfficeAddinMock = require("office-addin-mock");
const myExcelAddinFeature = require("../my-excel-add-in-feature");

// Create the seed mock object.
const mockData = {
    workbook: {
      range: {
        address: "C2:G3",
      },
      // Mock the Workbook.getSelectRange method.
      getSelectedRange: function () {
        return this.range;
      },
    },
};

// Create the final mock object from the seed object.
const contextMock = new OfficeAddinMock.OfficeMockObject(mockData);

/* Code that calls the test framework goes below this line. */

// Jest test
test("getSelectedRangeAddress should return address of selected range", async function () {
  expect(await myOfficeAddinFeature.getSelectedRangeAddress(contextMock)).toBe("C2:G3");
});
```

#### Mocking a host object

This example assumes a Word add-in that has one of its features in a file named `my-word-add-in-feature.js`. The following shows the contents of the file.

```javascript
const myWordAddinFeature = {

  insertBlueParagraph: async () => {
    return Word.run(async (context) => {
      // Insert a paragraph at the end of the document.
      const paragraph = context.document.body.insertParagraph("Hello World", Word.InsertLocation.end);
  
      // Change the font color to blue.
      paragraph.font.color = "blue";
  
      await context.sync();
    });
  }
}

module.exports = myWordAddinFeature;
```

The test file, named `my-word-add-in-feature.test.js` is in a subfolder, relative to the location of the add-in code file. The following shows the contents of the file. Note that the top level property is `context`, a `ClientRequestContext` object, so the object that is being mocked is the parent of this property: a `Word` object. Note the following about this code:

- When the `OfficeMockObject` constructor creates the final mock object, it will ensure that the child `ClientRequestContext` object has `sync` and `load` methods.
- The `OfficeMockObject` constructor does *not* add a `run` method to the mock `Word` object, so it must be added explicitly in the seed object.
- The `OfficeMockObject` constructor does *not* add all of the Word enum classes to the mock `Word` object, so the `InsertLocation.end` value that is referenced in the add-in method must be added explicitly in the seed object.
- Because the Office JavaScript library isn't loaded in the node process, the `Word` object that is referenced in the add-in code must be declared and initialized.

```javascript
const OfficeAddinMock = require("office-addin-mock");
const myWordAddinFeature = require("../my-word-add-in-feature");

// Create the seed mock object.
const mockData = {
  context: {
    document: {
      body: {
        paragraph: {
          font: {},
        },
        // Mock the Body.insertParagraph method.
        insertParagraph: function (paragraphText, insertLocation) {
          this.paragraph.text = paragraphText;
          this.paragraph.insertLocation = insertLocation;
          return this.paragraph;
        },
      },
    },
  },
  // Mock the Word.InsertLocation enum.
  InsertLocation: {
    end: "end",
  },
  // Mock the Word.run method.
  run: async function(callback) {
    await callback(this.context);
  },
};

// Create the final mock object from the seed object.
const wordMock = new OfficeAddinMock.OfficeMockObject(mockData);

// Define and initialize the Word object that is called in the insertBlueParagraph function.
global.Word = wordMock;

/* Code that calls the test framework goes below this line. */

// Jest test set
describe("Insert blue paragraph at end tests", () => {

  test("color of paragraph", async function () {
    await myWordAddinFeature.insertBlueParagraph();  
    expect(wordMock.context.document.body.paragraph.font.color).toBe("blue");
  });

  test("text of paragraph", async function () {
    await myWordAddinFeature.insertBlueParagraph();
    expect(wordMock.context.document.body.paragraph.text).toBe("Hello World");
  });
})
```

## Adding mock objects, properties, and methods dynamically when testing

In some scenarios, efficient testing requires that mock objects be created or modified at runtime; that is, while the tests are running. The following are examples:

- The function that is being tested behaves differently when called a second time. You need to first test the function with one mock object, then change this mock object and test the function again with the changed mock object.
- You need to test a function against multiple similar, but not identical, mock objects. For example, you need to test a function with a mock object that has a color property and then test the function again with a mock object that has a text property, but is otherwise identical to the original mock object.

The `OfficeMockObject` has three methods to help in these scenarios.

- `OfficeMockObject.setMock` adds a property and value to a `OfficeMockObject` object. The following example adds the `address` property.

    ```javascript
    rangeMock.setMock("address", "G6:K9");
    ```

- `OfficeMockObject.addMockFunction` adds a mock function to a `OfficeMockObject` object, as shown in the following example.

    ```javascript
    workbookMock.addMockFunction("getSelectedRange", function () { 
      const range = {
        address: "B2:G5",
      };
      return range;
    });
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > The function parameter is optional. If it isn't present, an empty function is created.

- `OfficeMockObject.addMock` adds a new `OfficeMockObject` object as a property to an existing one and gives it a name. It would have the minimum members that all `OfficeMockObject` have, such as `load` and `sync`. Additional members can be added with the `setMock` and `addMockFunction` methods. The following is an example that adds a mock `Excel.WorkbookProtection` object as a `protection` property to a mock workbook. It then adds a `protected` property to the new mock object.

    ```javascript
    workbookMock.addMock("protection");
    workbookMock.protection.setMock("protected", true);
    ```
