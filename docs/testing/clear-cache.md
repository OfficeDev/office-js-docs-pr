# Clear the Office cache

You can remove an add-in that you've previously sideloaded on Windows, Mac, or iOS by clearing the Office cache on your computer. 

Additionally, if you make changes to your add-in's manifest (for example, update file names of icons or text of add-in commands), you should clear the Office cache and then re-sideload the add-in using updated manifest. Doing so will allow Office to render the add-in as it's described by the updated manifest.

## Clear the Office cache on Windows

To clear the Office cache on Windows, delete the contents of the folder `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Wef\`.

## Clear the Office cache on Mac

[!include[additional cache folders on Mac](../includes/mac-cache-folders.md)]

##  Clear the Office cache on iOS

To clear the Office cache on iOS, call `window.location.reload(true)` from JavaScript in the add-in to force a reload. Alternatively, you can reinstall Office.
