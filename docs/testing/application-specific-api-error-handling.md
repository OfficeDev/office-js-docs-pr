# Error handling with the application-specific JavaScript APIs

When you build an add-in using the [application-specific Office JavaScript APIs](../develop/application-specific-api-model.md), be sure to include error handling logic to account for runtime errors. Doing so is critical, due to the asynchronous nature of the APIs.

## Best practices

In our [code samples](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-samples) and [Script Lab](../overview/explore-with-script-lab.md) snippets, you'll notice that every call to `Excel.run`, `PowerPoint.run`, or `Word.run` is accompanied by a `catch` statement to catch any errors. We recommend that you use the same pattern when you build an add-in using the application-specific APIs.

```js
$("#run").on("click", () => tryCatch(run));

async function run() {
  await Excel.run(async (context) => {
      // Add your Excel JavaScript API calls here.

      // Await the completion of context.sync() before continuing.
    await context.sync();
    console.log("Finished!");
  });
}

/** Default helper for invoking an action and handling errors. */
async function tryCatch(callback) {
  try {
    await callback();
  } catch (error) {
    // Note: In a production add-in, you'd want to notify the user through your add-in's UI.
    console.error(error);
  }
}

```

## API errors

When an Office JavaScript API request doesn't run successfully, the API returns an error object that contains the following properties.

- **code**:  The `code` property of an error message contains a string that is part of `OfficeExtension.ErrorCodes` or `{application}.ErrorCodes` where *{application}* represents Excel, PowerPoint, or Word. For example, the error code "InvalidReference" indicates that the reference is not valid for the specified operation. Error codes are not localized.

- **message**: The `message` property of an error message contains a summary of the error in the localized string. The error message isn't intended for consumption by end users; you should use the error code and appropriate business logic to determine the error message that your add-in shows to end users.

- **debugInfo**: When present, the `debugInfo` property of the error message provides additional information that you can use to understand the root cause of the error.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use `console.log()` to print error messages to the console, those messages are only visible on the server. End users don't see those error messages in the add-in task pane or anywhere in the Office application. To report errors to the user, see [Error notifications](#error-notifications).

## Error codes and messages

The following tables list the errors that application-specific APIs may return.

> [!NOTE]
> The following tables list error messages you may encounter while using the application-specific APIs. If you're working with the Common API, see [Office Common API error codes](../reference/javascript-api-for-office-error-codes.md) to learn about relevant error messages.

|Error code | Error message | Notes |
|:----------|:--------------|:------|
|`AccessDenied` |You cannot perform the requested operation.|*None* |
|`ActivityLimitReached`|Activity limit has been reached.|*None* |
|`ApiNotAvailable`|The requested API is not available.|*None* |
|`ApiNotFound`|The API you are trying to use could not be found. It may be available in a newer version of the Office application. See [Office client application and platform availability for Office Add-ins](/javascript/api/requirement-sets) for more information.|*None* |

|`ContentLengthRequired`|A `Content-length` HTTP header is missing.|*None* |
|`GeneralException`|There was an internal error while processing the request.|*None* |
|`HostRestartNeeded` | The Office application needs to be restarted. | This error is thrown by the [Office.ribbon.requestUpdate()](/javascript/api/office/office.ribbon#office-office-ribbon-requestupdate-member(1)) method if the add-in that calls the method has been updated since the Office application started. |
|`InsertDeleteConflict`|The insert or delete operation attempted resulted in a conflict.|*None* |
|`InvalidArgument` |The argument is invalid or missing or has an incorrect format.|*None* |
|`InvalidBinding` |This object binding is no longer valid due to previous updates.|*None* |
|`InvalidOperation`|The operation attempted is invalid on the object.|*None* |
|`InvalidReference`|This reference is not valid for the current operation.|*None* |
|`InvalidRequest`  |Cannot process the request.|*None* |
|`InvalidRibbonDefinition` | Office has been given an invalid ribbon definition. | This error is thrown if an invalid [RibbonUpdateObject](/javascript/api/office/office.ribbonupdaterdata) is passed to the [Office.ribbon.requestUpdate()](/javascript/api/office/office.ribbon#office-office-ribbon-requestupdate-member(1)) method. |
|`InvalidSelection`|The current selection is invalid for this operation.|*None* |
|`ItemAlreadyExists`|The resource being created already exists.|*None* |
|`ItemNotFound` |The requested resource doesn't exist.|*None* |
|`MemoryLimitReached`|The memory limit has been reached. Your action could not be completed.|*None* |
|`NotImplemented`|The requested feature isn't implemented.| This could mean the API is in preview or only supported on a particular platform (such as online-only). See [Office client application and platform availability for Office Add-ins](/javascript/api/requirement-sets) for more information.|
|`RequestAborted`|The request was aborted during run time.|*None* |
|`RequestPayloadSizeLimitExceeded`|The request payload size has exceeded the limit. See the [Resource limits and performance optimization for Office Add-ins](../concepts/resource-limits-and-performance-optimization.md#excel-add-ins) article for more information.| This error only occurs in Office on the web.|
|`ResponsePayloadSizeLimitExceeded`|The response payload size has exceeded the limit. See the [Resource limits and performance optimization for Office Add-ins](../concepts/resource-limits-and-performance-optimization.md#excel-add-ins) article for more information.|  This error only occurs in Office on the web.|
|`ServiceNotAvailable`|The service is unavailable.|*None* |
|`Unauthenticated` |Required authentication information is either missing or invalid.|*None* |
|`UnsupportedFeature`|The operation failed because the source worksheet contains one or more unsupported features.|*None* |
|`UnsupportedOperation`|The operation being attempted is not supported.|*None* |

### Excel-specific error codes and messages

|Error code | Error message | Notes |
|:----------|:--------------|:------|
|`EmptyChartSeries`|The attempted operation failed because the chart series is empty.|*None* |
|`FilteredRangeConflict`|The attempted operation causes a conflict with a filtered range.|*None* |
|`FormulaLengthExceedsLimit`|The bytecode of the applied formula exceeds the maximum length limit. For Office on 32-bit machines, the bytecode length limit is 16384 characters. On 64-bit machines, the bytecode length limit is 32768 characters.| This error occurs in both Excel on the web and on desktop.|
|`GeneralException`|*Various.*|The data types APIs return `GeneralException` errors with dynamic error messages. These messages reference the cell that is the source of the error, and the problem that is causing the error, such as: "Cell A1 is missing the required property `type`."|
|`InactiveWorkbook`|The operation failed because multiple workbooks are open and the workbook being called by this API has lost focus.|*None* |
|`InvalidOperationInCellEditMode`|The operation isn't available while Excel is in Edit cell mode. Exit Edit mode by using the **Enter** or **Tab** keys, or by selecting another cell, and then try again.|*None* |
|`MergedRangeConflict`|Cannot complete the operation. A table can't overlap with another table, a PivotTable report, query results, merged cells, or an XML Map.|*None* |
|`NonBlankCellOffSheet`|Microsoft Excel can't insert new cells because it would push non-empty cells off the end of the worksheet. These non-empty cells might appear empty but have blank values, some formatting, or a formula. Delete enough rows or columns to make room for what you want to insert and then try again.|*None* |
|`OperationCellsExceedLimit`|The attempted operation affects more than the limit of 33554000 cells.| If the `TableColumnCollection.add API` triggers this error, confirm that there is no unintentional data within the worksheet but outside of the table. In particular, check for data in the right-most columns of the worksheet. Remove the unintended data to resolve this error. One way to verify how many cells that an operation processes is to run the following calculation: `(number of table rows) x (16383 - (number of table columns))`. The number 16383 is the maximum number of columns that Excel supports. <br><br>This error only occurs in Excel on the web. |
|`PivotTableRangeConflict`|The attempted operation causes a conflict with a PivotTable range.|*None* |
|`RangeExceedsLimit`|The cell count in the range has exceeded the maximum supported number. See the [Resource limits and performance optimization for Office Add-ins](../concepts/resource-limits-and-performance-optimization.md#excel-add-ins) article for more information.|*None* |
|`RefreshWorkbookLinksBlocked`|The operation failed because the user hasn't granted permission to refresh external workbook links.|*None* |
|`UnsupportedSheet`|This sheet type does not support this operation, since it is a Macro or Chart sheet.|*None* |

### Word-specific error codes and messages

|Error code | Error message | Notes |
|:----------|:--------------|:------|
|`SearchDialogIsOpen`|The search dialog is open.|*None* |
|`SearchStringInvalidOrTooLong`|The search string is invalid or too long.| The search string maximum is 255 characters. |

## Error notifications

How you report errors to users depends on the UI system you're using.

- If you're using React as the UI system, use the [Fluent UI](https://react.fluentui.dev) components and design elements. We recommend that error messages be conveyed with a [Dialog](https://react.fluentui.dev/?path=/docs/components-dialog--default) component. If the error is in the user's input, configure the [Input](https://react.fluentui.dev/?path=/docs/components-input--default) component to display the error as bold red text.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The [Alert](https://react.fluentui.dev/?path=/docs/preview-components-alert--default) component can also be used to report errors to users, but it's currently in preview and shouldn't be used in a production add-in. For information about its release status, see the [Fluent UI React v9 Component Roadmap](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/wiki/Fluent-UI-React-v9-Component-Roadmap).

- If you're not using React for the UI, consider using the older [Fabric UI](https://developer.microsoft.com/fluentui#/get-started/web#fabric-core) components implemented directly in HTML and JavaScript. Some example templates are in the [Office-Add-in-UX-Design-Patterns-Code](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-UX-Design-Patterns-Code/tree/master/templates) repository. Take a look especially in the dialog and navigation subfolders. The sample [Excel-Add-in-SalesLeads](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Excel-Add-in-SalesLeads) uses a message banner.
