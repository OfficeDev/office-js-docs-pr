# Sideload Office Add-ins in Office Online for testing

You can install an Office Add-in for testing without having to first put it in an add-in catalog by using sideloading. Sideloading can be done on either Office 365 or Office Online. The procedure is slightly different for the two platforms. 

When you sideload an add-in, the add-in manifest is stored in the browser's local storage, so if you clear the browser's cache, or switch to a different browser, you have to sideload the add-in again.


> [!NOTE]
> Sideloading as described in this article is supported on Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. To sideload an Outlook add-in, see [Sideload Outlook add-ins for testing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/add-ins/sideload-outlook-add-ins-for-testing).

The following video walks you through the process of sideloading your add-in on Office desktop or Office Online.

## Sideload an add-in when using Visual Studio

If you're using Visual Studio to develop your add-in, the process to sideload is similar. The only difference is that you will have to update the value of the **SourceURL** element in your manifest to include the full URL where the add-in is deployed. 

If you're currently developing your add-in, locate your add-in manifest.xml file, and update the **SourceLocation** element value to include an absolute URI. Visual Studio will put in a token for your localhost deployment.

For example: 

```xml
<SourceLocation DefaultValue="https://localhost:44300/App/Home/Home.html" />
```
