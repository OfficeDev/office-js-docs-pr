# Sideload Office Add-ins on Mac for testing

To see how your add-in will run on Office on Mac, you can sideload your add-in's manifest. This action won't enable you to set breakpoints and debug your add-in's code while it's running, but you can see how it behaves and verify that the UI is usable and rendering appropriately.

> [!NOTE]
> To sideload an Outlook add-in, see [Sideload Outlook add-ins for testing](../outlook/sideload-outlook-add-ins-for-testing.md).

## Prerequisites for Office on Mac

- A Mac running OS X v10.10 "Yosemite" or later with [Office on Mac](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/buy/compare-all-microsoft-365-products) installed.

- Word on Mac Version 15.18 (160109).

- Excel on Mac Version 15.19 (160206).

- PowerPoint on Mac Version 15.24 (160614).

- The manifest .xml file for the add-in you want to test.

## Sideload an add-in in Office on Mac

1. Use **Finder** to sideload the manifest file. Open **Finder** and then enter Command+Shift+G to open the **Go to folder** dialog.

1. Enter one of the following filepaths, based on the application you want to use for sideloading. If the `wef` folder doesn't exist on your computer, create it.

    - For Word:  `/Users/<username>/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Word/Data/Documents/wef`
    - For Excel:  `/Users/<username>/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Excel/Data/Documents/wef`
    - For PowerPoint: `/Users/<username>/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Powerpoint/Data/Documents/wef`

        > [!NOTE]
        > The remaining steps describe how to sideload a Word add-in.

1. Copy your add-in's manifest file to this `wef` folder.

## Remove a sideloaded add-in

You can remove a previously sideloaded add-in by clearing the Office cache on your computer. Details on how to clear the cache for each platform and application can be found in the article [Clear the Office cache](clear-cache.md).
