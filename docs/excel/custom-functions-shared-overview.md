# Overview: Run your add-in code in a shared JavaScript runtime (preview)

[!include[Running custom functions in shared JavaScript runtime note](../includes/excel-shared-runtime-preview-note.md)]

When running Excel on Windows or Mac, your add-in will run code for ribbon buttons, custom functions, and the task pane in separate JavaScript runtime environments. This creates limitations such as not being able to easily share global data, and not being able to access all CORS functionality from a custom function.

However, you can configure your Excel add-in to share code in the same JavaScript runtime (also referred to as a shared runtime). This enables better coordination across your add-in and access to the task pane DOM and CORS from all parts of your add-in.

Configuring a shared runtime enables the following scenarios:

- Your add-in will have a shared DOM that the ribbon, task pane, and custom functions can all access.
- Your custom functions will have full CORS support.
- Your custom functions can call Office.js APIs to read spreadsheet document data.
- Your add-in can run code as soon as the document is opened.
- Your add-in can continue running code after the task pane is closed.

When you run custom functions in a shared runtime with the task pane, it will run in a browser instance on different platforms as explained in [Browsers used by Office Add-ins](../concepts/browsers-used-by-office-web-add-ins.md). Additionally, any buttons that your Excel add-in displays on the ribbon will run in the same shared runtime. The following image shows how custom functions, the ribbon UI, and the task pane code will all run in the same JavaScript runtime.

## Differences when running custom functions in a shared runtime

When you configure your Excel add-in project to run custom functions in a shared runtime, there are a few differences from using the custom function runtime.

### Storage

You no longer need to use the **Storage** API to share data between the task pane, custom functions or ribbon UI. You can put global variables in the **window** object, or use your own preferred state management approach.

### Authentication

When you receive tokens as part of authentication, you don't need to use the **Storage** API to share them between the task pane, custom functions and ribbon UI. You can use your own preferred storage technique and storage location to share them, such as `localStorage`.

### Dialog API

You no longer need to use the **OfficeRuntime.Dialog** API to display a dialog from a custom function. You can use the same [Dialog API](../develop/dialog-api-in-office-add-ins.md) for custom functions, ribbon buttons, and the task pane.

### Debugging

When using a shared runtime, you can't use Visual Studio Code to debug custom functions in Excel on Windows at this time. You'll need to use developer tools. For more information, see [Debug add-ins using developer tools on Windows 10](../testing/debug-add-ins-using-f12-developer-tools-on-windows-10.md).

## Get Started

To configure your Excel add-in project to run custom functions in a shared runtime, see [Configure your Excel add-in to use a shared JavaScript runtime (preview)](configure-your-add-in-to-use-a-shared-runtime.md).
