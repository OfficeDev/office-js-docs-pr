# Troubleshooting Excel Add-ins

This article discusses troubleshooting issues that are unique to Excel. Please use the feedback tool at the bottom of the page to suggest other issues that can be added to the article.

## API limitations when the active workbook switches

Add-ins for Excel are intended to operate on a single workbook at a time. Errors can arise when a workbook that is separate from the one running the add-in gains focus. This only happens when particular methods are in the process of being called when the focus changes.

The following APIs are affected by this workbook switch:

|Excel JavaScript API | Error thrown |
|--|--|
| `Chart.activate` | GeneralException |
| `Range.select` | GeneralException |
| `Table.clearFilters` | GeneralException |
| `Workbook.getActiveCell`  | InvalidSelection|
| `Workbook.getSelectedRange` | InvalidSelection|
| `Workbook.getSelectedRanges`  | InvalidSelection|
| `Worksheet.activate` | GeneralException |
| `Worksheet.delete`  | InvalidSelection|
| `Worksheet.gridlines` | GeneralException |
| `Worksheet.showHeadings` | GeneralException |
| `WorksheetCollection.add` | GeneralException |
| `WorksheetFreezePanes.freezeAt` | GeneralException |
| `WorksheetFreezePanes.freezeColumns` | GeneralException |
| `WorksheetFreezePanes.freezeRows` | GeneralException |
| `WorksheetFreezePanes.getLocationOrNullObject`| GeneralException |
| `WorksheetFreezePanes.unfreeze` | GeneralException |

> [!NOTE]
> This only applies to multiple Excel workbooks open on Windows or Mac.

## Coauthoring

See [Coauthoring in Excel add-ins](co-authoring-in-excel-add-ins.md) for patterns to use with events in a coauthoring environment. The article also discusses potential merge conflicts when using certain APIs, such as [`TableRowCollection.add`](/javascript/api/excel/excel.tablerowcollection#add-index--values-).
