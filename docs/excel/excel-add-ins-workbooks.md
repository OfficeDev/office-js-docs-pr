# Work with Workbooks using the Excel JavaScript API

This article provides code samples that show how to perform common tasks with workbooks using the Excel JavaScript API. For the complete list of properties and methods that the **Workbook** object supports, see [Workbook Object (JavaScript API for Excel)](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/excel/excel.workbook). This article also covers workbook-level actions performed through other similarly scoped objects, such as [Application](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/excel/excel.application).

The workbook object is the entry point for your add-in to interact with Excel. It contains a [WorksheetCollection](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/excel/excel.worksheetcollection) to manipulate individual worksheets. Most work done to [ranges](excel-add-ins-ranges.md) happens directly through a worksheet. The article [Work with Worksheets using the Excel JavaScript API](excel-add-ins-worksheets.md) describes how to access and edit worksheets.

## Get active cell and selected range

Workbooks maintain collections of worksheets, tables, PivotTables, and other data types through which Excel data is accessed and changed. They also have application-level information (more on that later). There are a pair of methods to directly get ranges the Excel user has just activated. The first is `getActiveCell()`. This method gets the active cell from the workbook as a [Range object](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/excel/excel.range). The following example shows a call to `getActiveCell()`, followed by the cell's address being printed to the console.


```js
Excel.run(function (context) {
    var activeCell = context.workbook.getActiveCell();
	activeCell.load("address");

    return context.sync().then(function () {
		console.log("The active cell is " + activeCell.address);
	});
}).catch(errorHandlerFunction);
```

The second range access method is `getSelectedRange()`. This method returns the range currently selected by either a user or an add-in. The following example shows a call to `getSelectedRange()` that then sets the range's fill color to yellow.

```js
Excel.run(function(context) {
	var range = context.workbook.getSelectedRange();
	range.format.fill.color = "yellow";
	return context.sync();
}).catch(errorHandlerFunction);
```

## Create Workbook

Your add-in can create a new workbook, separate from the Excel instance in which the add-in is currently running. The Excel object has the `createWorkbook` method for this purpose. When this method is called, the new workbook is immediately opened and displayed. This happens in a new Excel instance. Your add-in remains open and running with the previous workbook.

```js
Excel.createWorkbook();
```

`createWorkbook` takes in an optional string. This string is an .xlsx file in base64 encoding. Assuming the string argument is a valid .xlsx file, the resulting workbook will be a copy of that file. You can get your add-inâ€™s current workbook as a base64-encoded string by using [file slicing](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/office/office.document#getfileasync-filetype--options--callback-). The [FileReader](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/FileReader) class can be used to convert a file into the required base64-encoded string, as demonstrated in the following example. 

```js
var myFile = document.getElementById("file");
var reader = new FileReader();

reader.onload = (function (event) {
	Excel.run(function (context) {
		// strip off the metadata before the base64-encoded string
		var startIndex = event.target.result.indexOf("base64,");
		var mybase64 = event.target.result.substr(startIndex + 7);

		Excel.createWorkbook(mybase64);
		return context.sync();
	}).catch(errorHandlerFunction);
});

// read in the file as a data URL so we can parse the base64-encoded string
reader.readAsDataURL(myFile.files[0]);
```

## Protection

Your add-in can control a user's ability to edit the worksheet structure. The workbook's `protection` property is a [WorkbookProtection](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/excel/excel.workbookprotection) object with a `protect()` method. The following example shows a basic scenario toggling the protection of the workbook's structure. 

```js
Excel.run(function (context) {
	var workbook = context.workbook;
	workbook.load("protection/protected");

	return context.sync().then(function() {
		if (!workbook.protection.protected) {
			workbook.protection.protect();
		}
	});
}).catch(errorHandlerFunction);
```

The `protect` method also has an optional string parameter, `password`. This string represents the password needed for a user to bypass protection and change the workbook's structure.

Protection can also be set at the worksheet level. Protection on the worksheet guards against unwanted data editing. For more information, the Data protection section of the [Work with Worksheets using the Excel JavaScript API](excel-add-ins-worksheets.md#data-protection) article.

## Document properties

A workbook has access to the Office file metadata, which is known as the [document properties](https://support.office.com/article/View-or-change-the-properties-for-an-Office-file-21D604C2-481E-4379-8E54-1DD4622C6B75). The workbook's `properties` property is a [DocumentProperties](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/excel/excel.documentproperties) object containing these metadata values. The following example shows how to set the author property.

```js
Excel.run(function (context) {
	var docProperties = context.workbook.properties;
	docProperties.author = "Alex";
	return context.sync();
}).catch(errorHandlerFunction);
```

You can also define custom properties. The `DocumentProperties` object has `custom`: a map defining key-value pairs for user-defined properties. The following example shows how to create a custom "Introduction" property with the value "Hello", then retrieve it.

```js
Excel.run(function (context) {
	var customDocProperties = context.workbook.properties.custom;
	customDocProperties.add("Introduction", "Hello");
	return context.sync();
}).catch(errorHandlerFunction);

[...]

Excel.run(function (context) {
	var customDocProperties = context.workbook.properties.custom;
	var customProperty = customDocProperties.getItem("Introduction");
	customProperty.load("key, value");

	return context.sync().then(function() {
        console.log("Custom key  : " + customProperty.key); // "Introduction"
        console.log("Custom value : " + customProperty.value); // "Hello"
	});
}).catch(errorHandlerFunction);
```

## Document settings

A workbook's settings are similar to the collection of custom properties. The different is settings are unique to a single Excel file and add-in pairing, whereas properties are solely connected to the file. The following example shows how to create and access a setting.

```js
Excel.run(function (context) {
	var settings = context.workbook.settings;
	settings.add("NeedsReview", true);
	var needsReview = settings.getItem("NeedsReview");
	needsReview.load("value");

	return context.sync().then(function() {
		console.log("Workbook needs review : " + needsReview.value);
	});
}).catch(errorHandlerFunction);
```

## Calculations

By default, Excel recalculates formula results whenever a referenced cell is changed. Your add-in's performance may benefit from adjusting this calculation behavior. The application object has a `calculationMode` property of type `CalculationMode`. It can be set to the following values:

 - `automatic`: The default recalculation behavior where Excel calculates new formula results every time the relevant data is changed.
 - `automaticExceptTables`: Same as `automatic`, except any changes made to values in tables are ignored.
 - `manual`: Calculations only occur when the user or add-in requests them.
 
Application objects provide a method to force an immediate recalculation. `Application.calculate(calculationType)` starts a manual recalculation based on the provided `CalculationType`. The following values can be provided:

 - `full`: Recalculate all formulas in all open workbooks, regardless of whether they have changed since the last recalculation.
 - `fullRebuild`: Check dependent formulas, and then recalculate all formulas in all open workbooks, regardless of whether they have changed since the last recalculation.
 - `recalculate`: Recalculate formulas that have changed (or been programmatically marked for recalculation) since the last calculation, and formulas dependent on them, in all active workbooks.
 
The article [Change formula recalculation, iteration, or precision](https://support.office.com/article/change-formula-recalculation-iteration-or-precision-73fc7dac-91cf-4d36-86e8-67124f6bcce4) provides more context on the recalculation terminology.

The Excel API also lets add-ins turn off calculations until `RequestContext.sync()` is called. This is done with `suspendApiCalculationUntilNextSync()`. Use this method when you are editing large ranges without needing to access the data between edits.

```js
context.application.suspendApiCalculationUntilNextSync();
```
