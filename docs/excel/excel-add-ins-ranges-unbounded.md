# Read or write to an unbounded range using the Excel JavaScript API

Use these guidelines to understand how entire-column and entire-row addresses behave, and apply patterns that reduce errors and memory usage. For the complete list of properties and methods that the `Range` object supports, see [Excel.Range class](/javascript/api/excel/excel.range).

## Key points

- "Unbounded" means entire columns (like `A:F`) or entire rows (such as `2:2`).
- Cell-level properties (like `values`, `text`, `numberFormat`, or `formulas`) come back as `null` for unbounded reads.
- You can't set cell-level properties on an unbounded range. This returns an error.
- Always narrow to the used cells first.
- Use `getUsedRange()` or intersect with a bounded range to get real cells.
- Prefer explicit bounds (like `A1:F5000`) for speed and lower memory use.

The following are examples of unbounded ranges.

- Range addresses comprised of entire columns.
  - `C:C`
  - `A:F`
- Range addresses comprised of entire rows.
  - `2:2`
  - `1:4`

## Read an unbounded range

When you request an unbounded range (for example, `getRange('C:C')`), the response returns `null` for cell-level properties like `values`, `text`, `numberFormat`, and `formula`. Other properties (`address`, `cellCount`) are still valid.

## Write to an unbounded range

You can't set cell-level properties like `values`, `numberFormat`, or `formula` on an unbounded range because the request is too large. For example, the next code sample fails because it sets `values` for an unbounded range.

```js
// Invalid: Attempting to write cell-level data to unbounded columns.
let range = context.workbook.worksheets.getActiveWorksheet().getRange("A:B");
range.values = [["Due Date"]]; // This throws an error.
```

## Alternatives to unbounded addresses

| Goal | Prefer this approach | Why |
|------|----------------------|-----|
| Apply style to a column in use | `getUsedRange().getIntersection(sheet.getRange("A:A"))` | Avoid formatting unused cells |
| Add formulas to growing dataset | Write formulas only to populated rows; watch for new rows | Reduces recalculation work |
| Read dataset sized by import | Use `usedRange` then read in pages | Known size |
| Conditional formatting | Limit to known data rectangle | Better performance |
