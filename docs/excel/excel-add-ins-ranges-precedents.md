# Get formula precedents using the Excel JavaScript API

This article provides a code sample that retrieves formula precedents using the Excel JavaScript API. For the complete list of properties and methods that the `Range` object supports, see [Excel.Range class](/javascript/api/excel/excel.range).

## Get formula precedents

An Excel formula often refers to other cells. When a cell provides data to a formula, it is known as a formula "precedent". To learn more about Excel features related to relationships between cells, see [Display the relationships between formulas and cells](https://support.microsoft.com/office/display-the-relationships-between-formulas-and-cells-a59bef2b-3701-46bf-8ff1-d3518771d507). 

With [Range.getDirectPrecedents](/javascript/api/excel/excel.range#getdirectprecedents--), your add-in can locate a formula's direct precedent cells. `Range.getDirectPrecedents` returns a `WorkbookRangeAreas` object. This object contains the addresses of all the precedents in the workbook. It has a separate `RangeAreas` object for each worksheet containing at least one formula precedent. For more information on working with the `RangeAreas` object, see [Work with multiple ranges simultaneously in Excel add-ins](excel-add-ins-multiple-ranges.md).

In the Excel UI, the **Trace Precedents** button draws an arrow from precedent cells to the selected formula. Unlike the Excel UI button, the `getDirectPrecedents` method does not draw arrows. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `getDirectPrecedents` method can't retrieve precedent cells across workbooks. 

The following code sample gets the direct precedents for the active range and then changes the background color of those precedent cells to yellow. 

> [!NOTE]
> The active range must contain a formula that references other cells in the same workbook for the highlighting to work properly. 

```js
Excel.run(function (context) {
    // Precedents are cells that provide data to the selected formula.
    var range = context.workbook.getActiveCell();
    var directPrecedents = range.getDirectPrecedents();
    range.load("address");
    directPrecedents.areas.load("address");
    
    return context.sync()
        .then(function () {
            console.log(`Direct precedentâ€¯cells of ${range.address}:`);

            // Use the direct precedents API to loop through precedents of the active cell.
            for (var i = 0; i < directPrecedents.areas.items.length; i++) {
              // Highlight and print out the address of each precedent cell.
              directPrecedents.areas.items[i].format.fill.color = "Yellow";
              console.log(`  ${directPrecedents.areas.items[i].address}`);
            }
        })
        .then(context.sync);
}).catch(errorHandlerFunction);
```
