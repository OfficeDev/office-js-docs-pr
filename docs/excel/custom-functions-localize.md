# Localize custom functions

To make your custom functions work around the world, localize them into different languages. To localize custom functions, you need to provide localized function names in the functions' JSON file and provide locale information in the XML manifest file. At this time, autogenerated metadata does not work for localization so you need to write your JSON file by hand.

## Localize function names

To declare a localized function name, create additional `name` and `description` properties within your function's JSON file. You can declare multiple localized names and descriptions.

The `name` and `description` appear in Excel and are localized. However, the `id` of each function is not localized. The `id` property is how Excel identifies your function as unique and should not be changed once it is set.

In the following code sample, you'll see the JSON file for a function with the `id` property "MULTIPLY." The `name` and `description` property of the function is localized for German. Each parameter `name` and `description` is also localized for German.

```JSON
{
    "id": "MULTIPLY",
    "name": "SUMME",
    "description": "Summe zwei Zahlen",
    "helpUrl": "http://www.contoso.com",
    "result": {
        "type": "number",
        "dimensionality": "scalar"
    },
    "parameters": [
        {
            "name": "eins",
            "description": "Erste Nummer",
            "dimensionality": "scalar"
        },
        {
            "name": "zwei",
            "description": "Zweite Nummer",
            "dimensionality": "scalar"
        },
    ],
}
```

Compare the previous JSON with the following JSON for English.

```JSON
{
    "id": "MULTIPLY",
    "name": "Multiply",
    "description": "Multiplies two numbers",
    "helpUrl": "http://www.contoso.com",
    "result": {
        "type": "number",
        "dimensionality": "scalar"
    },
    "parameters": [
        {
            "name": "one",
            "description": "first number",
            "dimensionality": "scalar"
        },
        {
            "name": "two",
            "description": "second number",
            "dimensionality": "scalar"
        },
    ],
}
```

## Localize your add-in

After creating a JSON file for each language, you need to update your XML manifest file with an override value for each locale that specifies the URL of each JSON metadata file. The following manifest XML shows a default `en-us` locale with an override JSON file URL for `de-de` (Germany). The **functions-de.json** file contains the localized German function names and ids.

```XML
<DefaultLocale>en-us</DefaultLocale>
...
<Resources>
     <bt:Urls>
        <bt:Url id="Contoso.Functions.Script.Url" DefaultValue="https://localhost:3000/dist/functions.js"/>
          <bt:Override Locale="de-de" Value="https://localhost:3000/src/functions/functionsInGerman.js" />
     </bt:Urls>
</Resources>
```

If you're using the Yo Office generator to make your custom functions project, make sure your webpack.config.js file is properly configured to handle the proper script files.
