# Custom functions naming and localization

This article lists simple rules and tips for naming custom functions and shows how to localize them.

## Custom functions naming guidelines

A custom function is identified by an `id` and a `name` in the JSON metadata.

- `id`: Unique identifier used in code.
- `name`: Display name shown to users. It can be localized.

[!include[Excel custom functions note](../includes/excel-custom-functions-note.md)]

A function `name` can differ from the `id` for localization. If you don't need localization, using the same value is recommended.

A function's `name` and `id` share some similar rules.

- Both must start with a letter and be at least three characters.
- `id`: Only A–Z, 0–9, underscore, and period characters are allowed.
- `name`: Any Unicode alphabetic characters, underscore, and period characters are allowed.

Excel shows built‑in function names in uppercase letters (such as `SUM`). Using uppercase helps your custom functions fit in.

Avoid names that match:

- A cell reference (A1 to XFD1048576 or R1C1 style).
- An Excel 4.0 Macro Function (such as `RUN`, `ECHO`). For a full list of these functions, see [this Excel Macro Functions Reference document](https://www.myonlinetraininghub.com/cdn/files/Excel%204.0%20Macro%20Functions%20Reference.pdf).

## Naming conflicts

If your function `name` conflicts with one from another add‑in, Excel shows the **#REF!** error.

Fix conflicts by renaming your function or uninstalling the other add‑in. For testing in multiple environments, use a short namespace prefix (such as `ADDINNAME_FUNCTIONNAME`).

## Best practices

- Prefer extra function arguments over multiple near-duplicate function names.
- Avoid unclear abbreviations (`INCREASETIME` is clearer than `INC`).
- Use action verbs (`GETZIPCODE` not just `ZIPCODE`).
- Be consistent: Use the same verb for similar actions (`DELETEZIPCODE` and `DELETEADDRESS`).
- Consider adding `STREAM` or a note in the description for streaming functions.

## Naming constraints quick reference

| Aspect | `id` | `name` | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|-------|
| Allowed characters | A–Z 0–9 `_` `.` | Unicode alphabetic characters `_` `.` | Keep `id` simple. Localize `name`. |
| Starts with letter | Yes | Yes | Avoids cell reference confusion. |
| Minimum length | 3 | 3 | Short names reduce clarity. |
| Case style | Uppercase recommended | Uppercase recommended | Matches Excel style. |
| Localizable | No | Yes | Keep `id` stable. Localize `name` as needed. |
| Can mimic cell address | No | No | Prevent address parsing errors. |
| Reserved macro names | Disallowed | Disallowed | Some examples: `RUN`, `ECHO`. |

### Invalid `id` and `name` examples

| `id` | `name` | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| `1ADD` | `1ADD` | Starts with digit. |
| `A` | `A` | Too short (less than 3 characters). |
| `SUM` | `SUM` | Built‑in Excel formula name. |
| `MÜLTIPLY` | `MÜLTIPLY` | Non-ASCII letter in `id`. |
| `GET-VALUE` | `GET-VALUE` | Hyphen not allowed. Use underscore instead. |
| `RUN` | `RUN` | Reserved macro name. |
| `A1R1` | `A1R1` | Looks like a cell reference. |

### Recommended namespace pattern

For many functions, add a short vendor prefix such as `CONTOSO_GETPRICE` or `CONTOSO_TAX_CALC` to reduce conflicts with other add-ins.

## Localize custom functions

You can localize both your add-in and your custom function names. Add localized function names in JSON and locale overrides in the add-in only manifest.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Autogenerated metadata doesn't work for localization so you need to update the JSON file manually. To learn how to do this, see [Manually create JSON metadata for custom functions](custom-functions-json.md).

### Localize function names

Create one JSON metadata file per language. In each, localize `name` and `description`. The default English file is **functions.json**. Add locale tags to new files, like **functions-de.json**.

Excel only localizes `name` and `description`. The `id` is not localized and shouldn't be changed once it's set.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Avoid an `id` or `name` that matches a built‑in Excel function in any language.

The following JSON shows how to define a function with the `id` property "MULTIPLY". The `name` and `description` property of the function is localized for German. Each parameter `name` and `description` is also localized for German.

```json
{
    "id": "MULTIPLY",
    "name": "SUMME",
    "description": "Summe zwei Zahlen",
    "helpUrl": "http://www.contoso.com",
    "result": {
        "type": "number",
        "dimensionality": "scalar"
    },
    "parameters": [
        {
            "name": "eins",
            "description": "Erste Nummer",
            "dimensionality": "scalar"
        },
        {
            "name": "zwei",
            "description": "Zweite Nummer",
            "dimensionality": "scalar"
        }
    ]
}
```

Compare the previous JSON with the following JSON for English.

```json
{
    "id": "MULTIPLY",
    "name": "MULTIPLY",
    "description": "Multiplies two numbers",
    "helpUrl": "http://www.contoso.com",
    "result": {
        "type": "number",
        "dimensionality": "scalar"
    },
    "parameters": [
        {
            "name": "one",
            "description": "first number",
            "dimensionality": "scalar"
        },
        {
            "name": "two",
            "description": "second number",
            "dimensionality": "scalar"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Localize your add-in

After creating each language file, add an override value to the add-in only manifest that points to that file. The following manifest XML shows a default `en-us` locale plus an override JSON file URL for `de-de` (Germany).

```XML
<DefaultLocale>en-us</DefaultLocale>
...
<Resources>
     <bt:Urls>
        <bt:Url id="Contoso.Functions.Metadata.Url" DefaultValue="https://localhost:3000/dist/functions.json"/>
          <bt:Override Locale="de-de" Value="https://localhost:3000/dist/functions-de.json" />
        </bt:url>
        
     </bt:Urls>
</Resources>
```

For more information on the process of localizing an add-in, see [Localization for Office Add-ins](../develop/localization.md#control-localization-from-the-manifest).
