# Custom functions naming and localization

This article provides guidelines and best practices for naming custom functions and explains how to localize them.

## Custom functions naming guidelines

A custom function is identified by an `id` and a `name` in the JSON metadata.

- `id`: Unique identifier used in code.
- `name`: Display name shown to users. It can be localized.

[!include[Excel custom functions note](../includes/excel-custom-functions-note.md)]

A function `name` can differ from the `id` for localization. If you don't need localization, it's best to use the same value for both.

A function's `name` and `id` share some similar rules.

- Both must start with a letter and be at least three characters.
- `id`: Only A–Z, 0–9, underscore, and period characters are allowed.
- `name`: Any Unicode alphabetic characters, underscore, and period characters are allowed.

Excel displays built-in function names in uppercase letters (for example, `SUM`). Use uppercase for your custom functions to help them blend in naturally.

Avoid names that match:

- A cell reference (A1 to XFD1048576 or R1C1 to R1048576C16384).
- An Excel 4.0 Macro Function (such as `RUN`, `ECHO`). For a full list of these functions, see [this Excel Macro Functions Reference document](https://www.myonlinetraininghub.com/cdn/files/Excel%204.0%20Macro%20Functions%20Reference.pdf).

## Naming conflicts

If your function `name` conflicts with one from another add-in, Excel shows the **#REF!** error.

Fix conflicts by renaming your function or uninstalling the other add-in. For testing in multiple environments, use a short namespace prefix (such as `ADDINNAME_FUNCTIONNAME`).

## Best practices

- Use extra function arguments instead of creating multiple similar function names. For example, `GETNAME(firstName, middleName, lastName)` is more efficient than having separate functions like `GETFIRSTNAME`, `GETMIDDLENAME`, and `GETLASTNAME`.
- Avoid abbreviations that aren’t clear. For example, `INCREASETIME` is easier to understand than `INC`.
- Choose action verbs for function names. Use `GETZIPCODE` instead of just `ZIPCODE`.
- Be consistent. Use the same verb for similar actions, such as `DELETEZIPCODE` and `DELETEADDRESS`.
- For streaming functions, add `STREAM` to the name or include a note in the description.
- Use a short vendor prefix in your function names to avoid conflicts with other add-ins. For example, use `CONTOSO_GETPRICE` or `CONTOSO_TAX_CALC`.

## Naming constraints quick reference

| Guideline | `id` | `name` | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|-------|
| Allowed characters | A–Z 0–9 `_` `.` | Unicode alphabetic characters `_` `.` | Keep `id` simple. Localize `name`. |
| Must start with a letter | Yes | Yes | Avoids cell reference confusion. |
| Minimum length | 3 | 3 | Short names reduce clarity. |
| Capitalization | All uppercase recommended | All uppercase recommended | Matches Excel style. |
| Localizable | No | Yes | Keep `id` stable. Localize `name` as needed. |
| Can mimic cell address | No | No | Prevent address parsing errors. |
| Reserved macro names | Disallowed | Disallowed | Some examples: `RUN`, `ECHO`. |


## Localize custom functions

You can localize both your add-in and your custom function names. Add localized function names in your JSON file and set locale overrides in the add-in only manifest.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Autogenerated metadata doesn't work for localization so you need to update the JSON file manually. To learn how to do this, see [Manually create JSON metadata for custom functions](custom-functions-json.md).

### Localize function names

To localize your custom functions, create a separate JSON metadata file for each language. In each file, add the `name` and `description` properties in the target language. Use **functions.json** for English and include the locale in the filename for other languages, such as **functions-de.json** for German.

Excel only localizes the `name` and `description` properties. The `id` is not localized and should remain unchanged after it's set.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Avoid an `id` or `name` that matches a built-in Excel function in any language.

The following JSON shows how to define a function with the `id` property "MULTIPLY". The `name` and `description` property of the function is localized for German. Each parameter `name` and `description` is also localized for German.

```json
{
    "id": "MULTIPLY",
    "name": "SUMME",
    "description": "Summe zwei Zahlen",
    "helpUrl": "http://www.contoso.com",
    "result": {
        "type": "number",
        "dimensionality": "scalar"
    },
    "parameters": [
        {
            "name": "eins",
            "description": "Erste Nummer",
            "dimensionality": "scalar"
        },
        {
            "name": "zwei",
            "description": "Zweite Nummer",
            "dimensionality": "scalar"
        }
    ]
}
```

Compare the previous JSON with the following JSON for English.

```json
{
    "id": "MULTIPLY",
    "name": "MULTIPLY",
    "description": "Multiplies two numbers",
    "helpUrl": "http://www.contoso.com",
    "result": {
        "type": "number",
        "dimensionality": "scalar"
    },
    "parameters": [
        {
            "name": "one",
            "description": "first number",
            "dimensionality": "scalar"
        },
        {
            "name": "two",
            "description": "second number",
            "dimensionality": "scalar"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Localize your add-in

After you create a JSON for each language, add an override to your add-in only manifest that points to the correct file. The following manifest XML shows a default `en-us` locale plus an override JSON file URL for `de-de` (Germany).

```XML
<DefaultLocale>en-us</DefaultLocale>
...
<Resources>
     <bt:Urls>
        <bt:Url id="Contoso.Functions.Metadata.Url" DefaultValue="https://localhost:3000/dist/functions.json"/>
          <bt:Override Locale="de-de" Value="https://localhost:3000/dist/functions-de.json" />
        </bt:url>
        
     </bt:Urls>
</Resources>
```
