title: Runtime for Excel custom functions

# Runtime for Excel custom functions (Preview)

Custom functions extend Excel’s capabilities by using a new JavaScript runtime that uses a sandboxed JavaScript engine rather than a web browser. Because custom functions do not need to render UI elements, the new JavaScript runtime is optimized for performing calculations, enabling you to run thousands of custom functions simultaneously.

## Key facts about the new JavaScript runtime 

Only custom functions within an add-in will use the new JavaScript runtime that's described in this article. If an add-in includes other components such as task panes and other UI elements, in addition to custom functions, these other components of the add-in will continue to run in the browser-like WebView runtime.  Additionally: 

- The JavaScript runtime does not provide access to the Document Object Model (DOM) or support libraries like jQuery that rely on the DOM.

- A custom function that's defined in an add-in's JavaScript file can return a regular JavaScript `Promise` instead of returning `OfficeExtension.Promise`.  

- The JSON file that specifies custom function metatdata does not need to specify **sync** or **async** within **options**.

## New APIs 

The JavaScript runtime that's used by custom functions has the following APIs:

- [XHR](#xhr)
- [WebSockets](#websockets)
- [AsyncStorage](#asyncstorage)
- [Dialog API](#dialog-api)

### XHR

XHR stands for [XmlHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest), a standard web API that issues HTTP requests to interact with servers. In the new JavaScript runtime, XHR implements additional security measures by requiring [Same Origin Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy) and simple [CORS](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/).  

In the following code sample, the `getTemperature()` function sends a web request to get the temperature of a particular area based on thermometer ID. The `sendWebRequest()` function uses XHR to issue a `GET` request to an endpoint that can provide the data.  

```js
function getTemperature(thermometerID) {
  return new Promise(function(setResult) {
      sendWebRequest(thermometerID, function(data){ //sendWebRequest is defined later in this code sample
          storeLastTemperature(thermometerID, data.temperature);
          setResult(data.temperature);
      });
  });
}

//Helper method that uses Office's implementation of XMLHttpRequest in the new JavaScript runtime for custom functions  
function sendWebRequest(thermometerID, data) {
    var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
        if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
           data.temperature = JSON.parse(xhttp.responseText).temperature
          };
        xhttp.open("GET", "https://contoso.com/temperature/" + thermometerID), true)
        xhttp.send();  
    }
}

```

### WebSockets

[WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) is a networking protocol that creates real-time communication between a server and one or more clients. It is often used for chat applications because it allows you to read and write text simultaneously.  

As shown in the following code sample, custom functions can use WebSockets. In this example, the WebSocket logs each message that it receives.

```typescript
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://bundles.office.com');
ws.onmessage = (message) => {
    console.log(`Received: ${message}`);
};
ws.onerror = (error) => {
    console.err(`Failed: ${error}`);
}
```

### AsyncStorage

AsyncStorage is a key-value storage system that can be used to store authentication tokens. It is:

- Persistent
- Unencrypted
- Asynchronous

AsyncStorage is globally available to all parts of your add-in. For custom functions, `AsyncStorage` is exposed as a global object. (For other parts of your add-in, such as task panes and other elements that use the WebView runtime, AsyncStorage is exposed through `OfficeRuntime`.) Each add-in has its own storage partition, with a default size of 5MB. 

The following methods are available on the `AsyncStorage` object:
 
 - `getItem`
 - `setItem`
 - `removeItem`
 - `clear`
 - `getAllKeys`
 - `flushGetRequests`
 - `multiGet`
 - `multiSet`
 - `multiRemove`
 
At this time, the `mergeItem` and `multiMerge` methods are not supported.

The following code sample calls the `AsyncStorage.getItem` function to retrieve a value from storage.

```typescript
_goGetData = async () => {
    try {
        const value = await AsyncStorage.getItem('toDoItem');
        if (value !== null) {
            //data exists and you can do something with it here
            }
        } catch (error) {
            //handle errors here
        }
    }
}
```

### Dialog API

The Dialog API enables you to open a dialog box that prompts user sign-in. You can use the Dialog API to require user authentication through an outside resource, such as Google or Facebook, before the user can use your function.   

In the following code sample, the `getTokenViaDialog()` method uses the Dialog API’s `displayWebDialog()` method to open a dialog box.

```js
// Get auth token before calling my service, a hypothetical API that will deliver a stock price based on stock ticker string, such as "MSFT"
 
function getStock (ticker) {
  return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
    // Get a token
    getToken("https://www.contoso.com/auth")
    .then(function (token) {
      
      // Use token to get stock price
      fetch("https://www.contoso.com/?token=token&ticker= + ticker")
      .then(function (result) {

        // Return stock price to cell
        resolve(result);
      });
    })
    .catch(function (error) {
      reject(error);
    });
  });
  
  //Helper
  function getToken(url) {
    return new Promise(function (resolve,reject) {
      if(_cachedToken) {
        resolve(_cachedToken);
      } else {
        getTokenViaDialog(url)
        .then(function (result) {
          resolve(result);
        })
        .catch(function (result) {
          reject(result);
        });
      }
    });
  }

  function getTokenViaDialog(url) {
    return new Promise (function (resolve, reject) {
      if (_dialogOpen) {
        // Can only have one dialog open at once, wait for previous dialog's token
        let timeout = 5;
        let count = 0;
        var intervalId = setInterval(function () {
          count++;
          if(_cachedToken) {
            resolve(_cachedToken);
            clearInterval(intervalId);
          }
          if(count >= timeout) {
            reject("Timeout while waiting for token");
            clearInterval(intervalId);
          }
        }, 1000);
      } else {
        _dialogOpen = true;
        OfficeRuntime.displayWebDialog(url, {
          height: '50%',
          width: '50%',
          onMessage: function (message, dialog) {
            _cachedToken = message;
            resolve(message);
            dialog.closeDialog();
            return;
          },
          onRuntimeError: function(error, dialog) {
            reject(error);
          },
        }).catch(function (e) {
          reject(e);
        });
      }
    });
  }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The Dialog API described in this section is part of the new JavaScript runtime for custom functions and can be used only within custom functions. This API is different from the [Dialog API](../develop/dialog-api-in-office-add-ins.md) that can be used within task panes and add-in commands.
