# Runtime for Excel custom functions (preview)

Custom functions use a new JavaScript runtime that differs from the runtime used by other parts of an add-in, such as the task pane or other UI elements. This JavaScript runtime is designed to optimize performance of calculations in custom functions and exposes new APIs that you can use to perform common web-based actions within custom functions such as requesting external data or exchanging data over a persistent connection with a server. The JavaScript runtime also provides access to new APIs in the `OfficeRuntime` namespace that can be used within custom functions or by other parts of an add-in to store data or display a dialog box. This article describes how to use these APIs within custom functions and also outlines additional considerations to keep in mind as you develop custom functions.

[!include[Excel custom functions note](../includes/excel-custom-functions-note.md)]

## Requesting external data

Within a custom function, you can request external data by using an API like [Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) or by using [XmlHttpRequest (XHR)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest), a standard web API that issues HTTP requests to interact with servers. Within the JavaScript runtime, XHR implements additional security measures by requiring [Same Origin Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy) and simple [CORS](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/).  

### XHR example

In the following code sample, the `getTemperature` function calls the `sendWebRequest` function to get the temperature of a particular area based on thermometer ID. The `sendWebRequest` function uses XHR to issue a `GET` request to an endpoint that can provide the data.

> [!NOTE] 
> When using fetch or XHR, a new JavaScript `Promise` is returned. Prior to September 2018, you had to specify `OfficeExtension.Promise` to use promises within the Office JavaScript API, but now you can simply use a JavaScript `Promise`.

```js
function getTemperature(thermometerID) {
  return new Promise(function(setResult) {
      sendWebRequest(thermometerID, function(data){ 
          storeLastTemperature(thermometerID, data.temperature);
          setResult(data.temperature);
      });
  });
}

// Helper method that uses Office's implementation of XMLHttpRequest in the JavaScript runtime for custom functions  
function sendWebRequest(thermometerID, data) {
    var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
        if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
           data.temperature = JSON.parse(xhttp.responseText).temperature
        };
        xhttp.open("GET", "https://contoso.com/temperature/" + thermometerID), true)
        xhttp.send();  
    }
}
```

## Receiving data via WebSockets

Within a custom function, you can use [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) to exchange data over a persistent connection with a server. By using WebSockets, your custom function can open a connection with a server and then automatically receive messages from the server when certain events occur, without having to explicitly poll the server for data.

### WebSockets example

The following code sample establishes a `WebSocket` connection and then logs each incoming message from the server. 

```typescript
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://bundles.office.com');
ws.onmessage = (message) => {
    console.log(`Received: ${message}`);
};
ws.onerror = (error) => {
    console.err(`Failed: ${error}`);
}
```

## Storing and accessing data

Within a custom function (or within any other part of an add-in), you can store and access data by using the `OfficeRuntime.AsyncStorage` object. `AsyncStorage` is a persistent, unencrypted, key-value storage system that provides an alternative to [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage), which cannot be used within custom functions. An add-in can store up to 10 MB of data using `AsyncStorage`.

`AsyncStorage` is intended as a shared storage solution, meaning multiple parts of an add-in are able to access the same data. For example, tokens for user authentication may be stored in `AsyncStorage` because it can be accessed by both a custom function and add-in UI elements such as a task pane. Similarly, if two add-ins share the same domain (e.g. www.contoso.com/addin1, www.contoso.com/addin2), they are also permitted to share information back and forth through `AsyncStorage`. Note that add-ins which have different subdomains will have different instances of `AsyncStorage` (e.g. subdomain.contoso.com/addin1, differentsubdomain.contoso.com/addin2). 

Because `AsyncStorage` can be a shared location, it is important to realize that it is possible to override key-value pairs.

The following methods are available on the `AsyncStorage` object:
 
 - `getItem`
 - `setItem`
 - `removeItem`
 - `getAllKeys`
 - `flushGetRequests`
 - `multiGet`
 - `multiSet`
 - `multiRemove`: You will note that there is no implementation of a method for clearing all information (such as `clear`). Instead, you should instead use `multiRemove` to remove multiple entries at a time.

### AsyncStorage example 

The following code sample calls the `AsyncStorage.getItem` function to retrieve a value from storage.

```typescript
_goGetData = async () => {
    try {
        const value = await AsyncStorage.getItem('toDoItem');
        if (value !== null) {
            //data exists and you can do something with it here
        }
    } catch (error) {
        //handle errors here
    }
}
```

## Displaying a dialog box

Within a custom function (or within any other part of an add-in), you can use the `OfficeRuntime.displayWebDialogOptions` API to display a dialog box. This dialog API provides an alternative to the [Dialog API](../develop/dialog-api-in-office-add-ins.md) that can be used within task panes and add-in commands, but not within custom functions.

### Dialog API example

In the following code sample, the function `getTokenViaDialog` uses the Dialog API’s `displayWebDialogOptions` function to display a dialog box.

```js
// Get auth token before calling my service, a hypothetical API that will deliver a stock price based on stock ticker string, such as "MSFT"

function getStock (ticker) {
  return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
    // Get a token
    getToken("https://www.contoso.com/auth")
    .then(function (token) {

      // Use token to get stock price
      fetch("https://www.contoso.com/?token=token&ticker= + ticker")
      .then(function (result) {

        // Return stock price to cell
        resolve(result);
      });
    })
    .catch(function (error) {
      reject(error);
    });
  });
  
  //Helper
  function getToken(url) {
    return new Promise(function (resolve,reject) {
      if(_cachedToken) {
        resolve(_cachedToken);
      } else {
        getTokenViaDialog(url)
        .then(function (result) {
          resolve(result);
        })
        .catch(function (result) {
          reject(result);
        });
      }
    });
  }

  function getTokenViaDialog(url) {
    return new Promise (function (resolve, reject) {
      if (_dialogOpen) {
        // Can only have one dialog open at once, wait for previous dialog's token
        let timeout = 5;
        let count = 0;
        var intervalId = setInterval(function () {
          count++;
          if(_cachedToken) {
            resolve(_cachedToken);
            clearInterval(intervalId);
          }
          if(count >= timeout) {
            reject("Timeout while waiting for token");
            clearInterval(intervalId);
          }
        }, 1000);
      } else {
        _dialogOpen = true;
        OfficeRuntime.displayWebDialogOptions(url, {
          height: '50%',
          width: '50%',
          onMessage: function (message, dialog) {
            _cachedToken = message;
            resolve(message);
            dialog.closeDialog();
            return;
          },
          onRuntimeError: function(error, dialog) {
            reject(error);
          },
        }).catch(function (e) {
          reject(e);
        });
      }
    });
  }
}
```

## Additional considerations

In order to create an add-in that will run on multiple platforms (one of the key tenants of Office Add-ins), you should not access the Document Object Model (DOM) in custom functions or use libraries like jQuery that rely on the DOM. On Excel for Windows, where custom functions use the JavaScript runtime, custom functions cannot access the DOM.
