# Undo support with the Excel JavaScript API (preview)

Excel add-ins support undo behavior. This preserves both actions performed by Excel JavaScript APIs and actions performed by the user in Excel. These actions are saved in the *undo stack* for an individual user, allowing the user to step back through their actions when desired.

> [!NOTE]
> The features described in this article are currently available only in public preview. [!INCLUDE [Information about using preview APIs](../includes/using-excel-preview-apis.md)]

## Undo grouping

The Excel JavaScript API also supports undo grouping. This allows you to group multiple API calls into a single undoable action for your add-in user. For example, if your add-in needs to make several different updates across multiple worksheets in response to a single user command, you can wrap all those updates in a single group. This is done with the `mergeUndoGroup` property provided to the `Excel.run` function.

If an API within the group doesn't offer undo support, the `UndoNotSupported` error is thrown to let you know that the operation can’t be grouped. Your add-in should gracefully handle this error and present a reasonable message to the user.

The following code sample shows how to merge multiple actions with `mergeUndoGroup` set to `true`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure that all grouped API calls support undo to avoid errors. See [Unsupported APIs](#unsupported-apis) and [Check for undo support](#check-for-undo-support) for more information.

```js
await Excel.run({ mergeUndoGroup: true }, async (context) => { 
    const sheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getActiveWorksheet(); 
    let range = sheet.getRange("A1"); 
    range.values = [["123"]]; 
    
    await context.sync(); 
    
    range = sheet.getRange("B2"); 
    range.values = [["456"]];

    await context.sync(); 
}); 
```

## Unsupported APIs

Most Excel JavaScript APIs do support undo actions. However, see the following table for a list of APIs that do not support undo behavior.

> [!TIP]
> If you call an unsupported API in your add-in, the user’s undo stack is cleared starting from that API call, and a user cannot undo actions past that point.

## Check for undo support

Use the`isSetSupported` method of the [Office.RequirementSetSupport](/javascript/api/office/office.requirementsetsupport) interface to check for undo support and provide a fallback experience if undo support isn't available. See the following code sample for more information about how to use `isSetSupported`.

```js
if (Office.context.requirements.isSetSupported("ExcelUndoApiAll", "1.0")) { 
    // Undo is supported. 
} else { 
    // Undo is not supported.
} 
```
