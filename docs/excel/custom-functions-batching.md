# Batching web requests

Custom functions allow you to make requests to resources on the web and this article will detail a pattern to batch these requests. When batching, you'll bundle individual requests together into a larger request, rather than executing each request one by one.

> [!NOTE]
> This article assumes you're familiar with JavaScript Promises and assumes you've created a custom function before. To learn how to create a custom function, see the [Custom functions tutorial](../tutorials/excel-tutorial-create-custom-functions.md).

## Clone the batching code sample repository

This article is explained with a code sample, available in [this Github repository](https://github.com/OfficeDev/PnP-OfficeAddins/tree/master/Excel-custom-functions). Complete the following steps to get started with the code sample:

1. Clone the repository to your local computer and open the repositoryâ€™s root folder. You'll notice there are two files:

    * The file named fill-in.js is a set of code which you will fill in, given instructions in this tutorial.
    * The file named final-batching-sample.js gives a full code sample if you prefer to look at a whole code sample right away.

2. Open the file named fill-in.js in your favorite code editor.

3. Follow the steps in the next section to fill in the code at each point you come across a `TODO` in the code sample.

## Complete the `TODO` sections of the code sample

* **TODO #1**

   In the first `TODO` section you'll create two custom functions. One is called sum, which will take two numbers and add them together. The other is called multiply, which multiplies two numbers.

    To simplify your code, you'll create a method which takes the name of the operation the function performs and its arguments, called `_pushOperation`. You'll note that many of the functions in this sample use of an underscore in front of the function name, indicating that the function is not publicly accessible.

    Fill in the functions according to the following:

    ```js
    function sum() {
        return _pushOperation("sum", arguments);
    }

    function mul() {
        return _pushOperation("mul", arguments);
    }
    ```

    Next, the sample details the `_pushOperation` function. The function creates an invocation entry each time the function is invoked in Excel by a user. For example, every time a user calls your multiply function in a cell, a new `invocationEntry` is created. The invocation entry contains a description of what operation is performed, the arguments (or numbers to be summed or multiplied, as well as properties for resolved and rejected results from the operation. These properties are filled in by the returned values from this invocation's JavaScript Promise.

    Note that the function pushes this `invocationEntry` into a batch, which your code will later process.

* **TODO #2**

    Continuing in the `_pushOperation` function, you'll add some code to conditionally set a timeout event to occur if no batch is currently being processed. During this timeout, your function will send the batch to be remotely processed. Note that you should adjust this portion of code if you API requires longer processing time than two seconds or you wish to handle cases where the request does not complete in the allotted time (or at all).  

    Replace `TODO#2` with the following code:

    ```js
    if (!_isBatchedRequestScheduled) {
        setTimeout(_makeRemoteRequest, 2000);
        _isBatchedRequestScheduled = true;
    }
    ```

    Finally, the code sample returns the Promise for that invocationEntry.

* **TODO #3**

    Before the third `TODO` item, you'll notice that the `_isBatchedRequestScheduled` flag is set to false, because there is nothing to batch until an invocation of a function takes place.

    When an invocation happens, it is passed to the `batch` array to await processing, as shown in the following diagram. In the following diagram, three invocations of the `=STOCK` function are issued in Excel, giving a stock ticker and expecting a stock price in return. You'll note that the invocationEntries that are stored in the `batch` array contain both the raw information of the stock ticker symbol string as well as the unresolved Promise.

    ![Three calls of =STOCK function are issued and stored in the batch array.](../images/Batch1.svg "Batching diagram")

    To complete the third `TODO` item, you'll add the `_makeRemoteRequest` function that creates a copy of the original `batch`, clears out the `batch` array, and flips the `_isBatchScheduled` flag back to false. This copy is called `batchCopy` and contains the unresolved Promises from your invocation entries. Creating the copy enables you to build up another batch while you are waiting for a response from your API.

    Next, the `_makeRemoteRequest` function creates the `requestBatch` array, which contains just the raw information from the invocationEntries that needs to be processed by the API.

    The following diagram shows how the information from the `batch` array has been copied into the `batchCopy` array and how the stock ticker string information separated out to the `requestBatch` array. While the `requestBatch` is processing, the `batch` array can continue to fill with requests in the meantime.

    ![The batch array is copied and emptied.](../images/Batch2.svg "Batching diagram")

    To complete the third `TODO` item, add the following code.

    ```js
    function _makeRemoteRequest() {
        // Copy the shared batch and build a new batch while you await a response.

        var batchCopy = _batch.slice();
        _batch = [];
        _isBatchScheduled = false;
        // Build a simpler request batch that only contains the arguments for each invocation.

        var requestBatch = [];
        for (var i = 0; i < batchCopy.length; i++) {
            requestBatch[i] = {
                "operation": batchCopy[i].operation,
                "arguments": batchCopy[i].arguments
            };
    }
    ```

* **TODO #4**

    To complete the fourth `TODO`, continue filling in the `_makeRemoteRequest` function.

    The invocation entries from your `batchCopy` array still have unresolved Promises that need to be fulfilled. When the API returns the information that you need to fulfill these Promises, you'll match each response from the API to the Promises in the `batchCopy` array.

    Fill in `TODO#4`with the following code:

    ```js
        // Make the remote request.

        _fetchFromRemoteService(requestBatch)
        .then(function (responseBatch) {
        // Match each value from the response batch to its corresponding invocation entry from the request batch,
        // and resolve the invocation Promise with its corresponding response value.

            for (var i = 0; i < responseBatch.length; i++) {
            batchCopy[i].resolve(responseBatch[i]);
            }
        });
    }
    ```

    Through this process, the Promise for each invocation is fulfilled. Each _pushOperation returns in the cell where the function was originally called. In the following diagram, the API returns information to the `requestBatch` array, which resolves the Promises in the `batchCopy` array, which then provides the information for the return values of the original custom function invocations. The `batch` array is still empty, but could also begin filling with additional requests for the next batch to be processed.

    ![The API returns information to complete the unfulfilled Promises.](../images/Batch4.svg "Batching diagram")

    With completion of this step, you're done filling in `TODO` items in this sample.

    The rest of this code sample simulates what a public API would be doing to resolve your API request, for your reference.

## Apply this pattern to your own project

For purposes of your own project, you can use much of the provided code as a boilerplate, changing only items in `TODO` #4 to suit your needs. As mentioned previously, depending on how you choose to handle errors and on the specifics of your API, you may also need to implement some additional code for `TODO` #2.
