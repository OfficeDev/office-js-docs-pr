# Performance optimization using the Excel JavaScript API

There are multiple ways that you can perform common tasks with the Excel JavaScript API. You'll find significant performance differences between various approaches. This article provides guidance and code samples to show you how to perform common tasks efficiently using Excel JavaScript API.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Many performance issues can be addressed through recommended usage of `load` and `sync` calls. See the "Performance improvements with the application-specific APIs" section of [Resource limits and performance optimization for Office Add-ins](../concepts/resource-limits-and-performance-optimization.md#performance-improvements-with-the-application-specific-apis) for advice on working with the application-specific APIs in an efficient way.

## Suspend Excel processes temporarily

Excel has a number of background tasks reacting to input from both users and your add-in. Some of these Excel processes can be controlled to yield a performance benefit. This is especially helpful when your add-in deals with large data sets.

### Suspend calculation temporarily

If you are trying to perform an operation on a large number of cells (for example, setting the value of a huge range object) and you don't mind suspending the calculation in Excel temporarily while your operation finishes, we recommend that you suspend calculation until the next `context.sync()` is called.

See the [Application Object](/javascript/api/excel/excel.application) reference documentation for information about how to use the `suspendApiCalculationUntilNextSync()` API to suspend and reactivate calculations in a very convenient way. The following code demonstrates how to suspend calculation temporarily.

```js
Excel.run(async function(ctx) {
    var app = ctx.workbook.application;
    var sheet = ctx.workbook.worksheets.getItem("sheet1");
    var rangeToSet: Excel.Range;
    var rangeToGet: Excel.Range;
    app.load("calculationMode");
    await ctx.sync();
    // Calculation mode should be "Automatic" by default
    console.log(app.calculationMode);

    rangeToSet = sheet.getRange("A1:C1");
    rangeToSet.values = [[1, 2, "=SUM(A1:B1)"]];
    rangeToGet = sheet.getRange("A1:C1");
    rangeToGet.load("values");
    await ctx.sync();
    // Range value should be [1, 2, 3] now
    console.log(rangeToGet.values);

    // Suspending recalculation
    app.suspendApiCalculationUntilNextSync();
    rangeToSet = sheet.getRange("A1:B1");
    rangeToSet.values = [[10, 20]];
    rangeToGet = sheet.getRange("A1:C1");
    rangeToGet.load("values");
    app.load("calculationMode");
    await ctx.sync();
    // Range value should be [10, 20, 3] when we load the property, because calculation is suspended at that point
    console.log(rangeToGet.values);
    // Calculation mode should still be "Automatic" even with suspend recalculation
    console.log(app.calculationMode);

    rangeToGet.load("values");
    await ctx.sync();
    // Range value should be [10, 20, 30] when we load the property, because calculation is resumed after last sync
    console.log(rangeToGet.values);
})
```

Please note that only formula calculations are suspended. Any altered references are still rebuilt. For example, renaming a worksheet still updates any references in formulas to that worksheet.

### Suspend screen updating

Excel displays changes your add-in makes approximately as they happen in the code. For large, iterative data sets, you may not need to see this progress on the screen in real-time. `Application.suspendScreenUpdatingUntilNextSync()` pauses visual updates to Excel until the add-in calls `context.sync()`, or until `Excel.run` ends (implicitly calling `context.sync`). Be aware, Excel will not show any signs of activity until the next sync. Your add-in should either give users guidance to prepare them for this delay or provide a status bar to demonstrate activity.

> [!NOTE]
> Don't call `suspendScreenUpdatingUntilNextSync` repeatedly (such as in a loop). Repeated calls will cause the Excel window to flicker.

### Enable and disable events

Performance of an add-in may be improved by disabling events. A code sample showing how to enable and disable events is in the [Work with Events](excel-add-ins-events.md#enable-and-disable-events) article.

## Importing data into tables

When trying to import a huge amount of data directly into a [Table](/javascript/api/excel/excel.table) object directly (for example, by using `TableRowCollection.add()`), you might experience slow performance. If you are trying to add a new table, you should fill in the data first by setting `range.values`, and then call `worksheet.tables.add()` to create a table over the range. If you are trying to write data into an existing table, write the data into a range object via `table.getDataBodyRange()`, and the table will expand automatically.

Here is an example of this approach:

```js
Excel.run(async (ctx) => {
    var sheet = ctx.workbook.worksheets.getItem("Sheet1");
    // Write the data into the range first.
    var range = sheet.getRange("A1:B3");
    range.values = [["Key", "Value"], ["A", 1], ["B", 2]];

    // Create the table over the range
    var table = sheet.tables.add('A1:B3', true);
    table.name = "Example";
    await ctx.sync();


    // Insert a new row to the table
    table.getDataBodyRange().getRowsBelow(1).values = [["C", 3]];
    // Change a existing row value
    table.getDataBodyRange().getRow(1).values = [["D", 4]];
    await ctx.sync();
})
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can conveniently convert a Table object to a Range object by using the [Table.convertToRange()](/javascript/api/excel/excel.table#convertToRange__) method.

## Payload size limit best practices

The Excel JavaScript API has size limitations for API calls. Excel on the web has a payload size limit for requests and responses of 5MB, and an API returns a `RichAPI.Error` error if this limit is exceeded. On all platforms, a range is limited to five million cells for get operations. Large ranges typically exceed both of these limitations.

The payload size of a request is a combination of the following three components.

* The number of API calls
* The number of objects, such as `Range` objects
* The length of the value to set or get

If an API returns the `RequestPayloadSizeLimitExceeded` error, use the best practice strategies documented in this article to optimize your script and avoid the error.

### Strategy 1: Move unchanged values out of loops

Limit the number of processes that occur within loops to improve performance. In the following code sample, `context.workbook.worksheets.getActiveWorksheet()` can be moved out of the `for` loop, because it doesn't change within that loop.

```js
// DO NOT USE THIS CODE SAMPLE. This sample shows a poor performance strategy. 
async function run() {
  await Excel.run(async (context) => {
    var ranges = [];
    
    // This sample retrieves the worksheet every time the loop runs, which is bad for performance.
    for (let i = 0; i < 7500; i++) {
      var rangeByIndex = context.workbook.worksheets.getActiveWorksheet().getRangeByIndexes(i, 1, 1, 1);
    }    
    await context.sync();
  });
}
```

The following code sample shows logic similar to the preceding code sample, but with an improved performance strategy. The value `context.workbook.worksheets.getActiveWorksheet()` is retrieved before the `for` loop, because this value doesn't need to be retrieved each time the `for` loop runs. Only values that change within the context of a loop should be retrieved within that loop.

```js
// This code sample shows a good performance strategy.
async function run() {
  await Excel.run(async (context) => {
    var ranges = [];
    // Retrieve the worksheet outside the loop.
    var worksheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getActiveWorksheet(); 

    // Only process the necessary values inside the loop.
    for (let i = 0; i < 7500; i++) {
      var rangeByIndex = worksheet.getRangeByIndexes(i, 1, 1, 1);
    }    
    await context.sync();
  });
}
```

### Strategy 2: Create fewer range objects

Create fewer range objects to improve performance and minimize payload size. Two approaches for creating fewer range objects are described in the following article sections and code samples.

#### Split each range array into multiple arrays

One way to create fewer range objects is to split each range array into multiple arrays, and then process each new array with a loop and a new `context.sync()` call.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only use this strategy if you've first determined that you're exceeding the payload request size limit. Using multiple loops can reduce the size of each payload request to avoid exceeding the 5MB limit, but using multiple loops and multiple `context.sync()` calls also negatively impacts performance.

The following code sample attempts to process a large array of ranges in a single loop and then a single `context.sync()` call. Processing too many range values in one `context.sync()` call causes the payload request size to exceed the 5MB limit.

```js
// This code sample does not show a recommended strategy.
// Calling 10,000 rows would likely exceed the 5MB payload size limit in a real-world situation.
async function run() {
  await Excel.run(async (context) => {
    var worksheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getActiveWorksheet();
    
    // This sample attempts to process too many ranges at once. 
    for (let row = 1; row < 10000; row++) {
      var range = sheet.getRangeByIndexes(i, 1, 1, 1);
      range.values = [["1"]];
    }
    await context.sync(); 
  });
}
```

The following code sample shows logic similar to the preceding code sample, but with a strategy that avoids exceeding the 5MB payload request size limit. In the following code sample, the ranges are processed in two separate loops, and each loop is followed by a `context.sync()` call.

```js
// This code sample shows a strategy for reducing payload request size.
// However, using multiple loops and `context.sync()` calls negatively impacts performance.
// Only use this strategy if you've determined that you're exceeding the payload request limit.
async function run() {
  await Excel.run(async (context) => {
    var worksheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getActiveWorksheet();

    // Split the ranges into two loops, rows 1-5000 and then 5001-10000.
    for (let row = 1; row < 5000; row++) {
      var range = worksheet.getRangeByIndexes(i, 1, 1, 1);
      range.values = [["1"]];
    }
    // Sync after each loop. 
    await context.sync(); 
    
    for (let row = 5001; row < 10000; row++) {
      var range = worksheet.getRangeByIndexes(i, 1, 1, 1);
      range.values = [["1"]];
    }
    await context.sync(); 
  });
}
```

#### Set range values in an array

Another way to create fewer range objects is to create an array, use a loop to set all the data in that array, and then pass the array values to a range. This benefits both performance and payload size. Instead of calling `range.values` for each range in a loop, `range.values` is a called once outside the loop.

The following code sample shows how to create an array, set the values of that array in a `for` loop, and then pass the array values to a range outside the loop.

```js
// This code sample shows a good performance strategy.
async function run() {
  await Excel.run(async (context) => {
    const worksheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getActiveWorksheet();    
    // Create an array.
    const array = new Array(10000);

    // Set the values of the array inside the loop.
    for (var i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
      array[i] = [1];
    }

    // Pass the array values to a range outside the loop. 
    var range = worksheet.getRange("A1:A10000");
    range.values = array;
    await context.sync();
  });
}
```
