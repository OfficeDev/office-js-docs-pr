# COM add-in and XLL UDF compatibility requirements (preview)

COM add-in and XLL UDF compatibility is currently available on the following platforms:

- Excel Online
- Excel on Windows (64-bit version 1810 or later)
- Excel for Mac (version 13.329 or later)

## Excel Online
To use COM add-in and XLL UDF compatibility within Excel Online, login by using either your Office 365 subscription or a [Microsoft account](https://account.microsoft.com/account).

## Excel on Windows and Excel for Mac
To use COM add-in and XLL UDF compatibility within Excel on Windows or Excel for Mac, you must have an Office 365 subscription, join the [Office Insider](https://products.office.com/office-insider) program (**Insider** level -- formerly called "Insider Fast"), and use a sufficiently recent build of Excel (as specified previously).

If you are using a version of Office on your desktop which you downloaded from the Windows Store, you must be part of the [Windows Insider](https://insider.windows.com/) program at the **Insider** level (formerly called "Insider Fast"), running the April 2018 Update version or later to use COM add-in and XLL UDF compatibility. This is a new change as of January 2019.

## Subscribe to Office 365
If you don't already have an Office 365 subscription, you can get one by joining the [Office 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev-program).
