# Extend custom functions with XLL user-defined functions

If you have existing Excel XLLs, you can build equivalent custom functions in an Excel add-in to extend your solution features to other platforms such as online or macOS. However, Excel add-ins don't have all of the functionality available in XLLs. Depending on the functionality your solution uses, the XLL may provide a better experience than the Excel add-in custom functions in Excel on Windows.

> [!NOTE]
> COM add-in and XLL UDF compatibility is supported by the following platforms, when connected to an Office 365 subscription:
> - Excel on the web
> - Excel on Windows (version 1904 or later)
> - Excel on Mac (version 13.329 or later)
> 
> To use COM add-in and XLL UDF compatibility within Excel on the web, login by using either your Office 365 subscription or a [Microsoft account](https://account.microsoft.com/account). If you don't already have an Office 365 subscription, you can get one by joining the [Office 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/office/dev-program).

## Specify equivalent XLL in the manifest

To enable compatibility with an existing XLL, identify the equivalent XLL in the manifest of your Excel add-in. Then Excel will use the XLL's functions instead of your Excel add-in custom functions when running on Windows.

To set the equivalent XLL for your custom functions, specify the `FileName` of the XLL. When the user opens a workbook with functions from the XLL, Excel converts the functions to compatible functions. The workbook then uses the XLL when opened in Excel on Windows, and it will use custom functions from your Excel add-in when opened online or on macOS.

The following example shows how to specify both a COM add-in and an XLL as equivalent. Often you will specify both so for completeness this example shows both in context. They are identified by their `ProgId` and `FileName` respectively. The `EquivalentAddins` element must be positioned immediately before the closing `VersionOverrides` tag. For more information on COM add-in compatibility, see [Make your Excel add-in compatible with an existing COM add-in](../develop/make-office-add-in-compatible-with-existing-com-add-in.md).

```xml
<VersionOverrides>
  ...
  <EquivalentAddins>
    <EquivalentAddin>
      <ProgId>ContosoCOMAddin</ProgId>
      <Type>COM</Type>
    </EquivalentAddin>

    <EquivalentAddin>
      <FileName>contosofunctions.xll</FileName>
      <Type>XLL</Type>
    </EquivalentAddin>
  <EquivalentAddins>
</VersionOverrides>
```

> [!NOTE]
> If an add-in declares its custom functions to be XLL compatible, changing the manifest at a later time could break a userâ€™s workbook because it will change the file format.

## Custom function behavior for XLL compatible functions

When a spreadsheet is opened that contains XLL functions for which there is also an equivalent add-in, the XLL's functions are converted to XLL compatible custom functions. On the next save, they are written to the file in a compatible mode so that they work with both the XLL and Excel add-in custom functions (when on other platforms).

The following table compares features across XLL user-defined functions, XLL compatible custom functions, and Excel add-in custom functions.

|         |XLL user-defined function |XLL compatible custom functions |Excel add-in custom function |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Supported platforms | Windows | Windows, macOS, web browser | Windows, macOS, web browser |
| Supported file formats | XLSX, XLSB, XLSM, XLS | XLSX, XLSB, XLSM | XLSX, XLSB, XLSM |
| Formula autocomplete | No | Yes | Yes |
| Streaming | Possible via xlfRTD and XLL callback. | No | Yes |
| Localization of functions | No | No. The Name and ID must match the existing XLL's functions. | Yes |
| Volatile functions | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Multi-threaded recalculation support | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Calculation behavior | No UI. Excel can be unresponsive during calculation. | Users will see #BUSY! until a result is returned. | Users will see #BUSY! until a result is returned. |
| Requirement sets | N/A | CustomFunctions 1.1 and later | CustomFunctions 1.1 and later |
