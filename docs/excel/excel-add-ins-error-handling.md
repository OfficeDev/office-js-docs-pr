# Error handling

When you build an add-in using the Excel JavaScript API, be sure to include error handling logic to account for runtime errors. Doing so is critical, due to the asynchronous nature of the API.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about the **sync()** method and the asynchronous nature of Excel JavaScript API, see [Fundamental programming concepts with the Excel JavaScript API](excel-add-ins-core-concepts.md).

## Best practices

Throughout the code samples in this documentation, you'll notice that every call to `Excel.run` is accompanied by a `catch` statement to catch any errors that occur within the `Excel.run`. We recommend that you use the same pattern when you build an add-in using the Excel JavaScript APIs.

```js
Excel.run(function (context) {
  
  // Excel JavaScript API calls here

  // Await the completion of context.sync() before continuing.
  return context.sync()
    .then(function () {
      console.log("Finished!");
    })
}).catch(errorHandlerFunction);
```

## API errors

When an Excel JavaScript API request fails to run successfully, the API returns an error object that contains the following properties:

- **code**:  The `code` property of an error message contains a string that is part of the `OfficeExtension.ErrorCodes` or `Excel.ErrorCodes` list. For example, the error code "InvalidReference" indicates that the reference is not valid for the specified operation. Error codes are not localized.

- **message**: The `message` property of an error message contains a summary of the error in the localized string. The error message is not intended for consumption by end users; you should use the error code and appropriate business logic to determine the error message that your add-in shows to end users.

- **debugInfo**: When present, the `debugInfo` property of the error message provides additional information that you can use to understand the root cause of the error.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use `console.log()` to print error messages to the console, those messages will only be visible on the server. End users will not see those error messages in the add-in task pane or anywhere in the host application.

## Error Messages

The following table is a list of errors that the API may return.

|error.code | error.message |
|:----------|:--------------|
|InvalidArgument |The argument is invalid or missing or has an incorrect format.|
|InvalidRequest  |Cannot process the request.|
|InvalidReference|This reference is not valid for the current operation.|
|InvalidBinding  |This object binding is no longer valid due to previous updates.|
|InvalidSelection|The current selection is invalid for this operation.|
|Unauthenticated |Required authentication information is either missing or invalid.|
|AccessDenied |You cannot perform the requested operation.|
|ItemNotFound |The requested resource doesn't exist.|
|ActivityLimitReached|Activity limit has been reached.|
|GeneralException|There was an internal error while processing the request.|
|NotImplemented  |The requested feature isn't implemented.|
|ServiceNotAvailable|The service is unavailable.|
|Conflict|Request could not be processed because of a conflict.|
|ItemAlreadyExists|The resource being created already exists.|
|UnsupportedOperation|The operation being attempted is not supported.|
|RequestAborted|The request was aborted during run time.|
|ApiNotAvailable|The requested API is not available.|
|InsertDeleteConflict|The insert or delete operation attempted resulted in a conflict.|
|InvalidOperation|The operation attempted is invalid on the object.|
