# Error handling

When you build an add-in using the Excel JavaScript API, be sure to include error handling logic to account for runtime errors. Doing so is critical, due to the asynchronous nature of the API.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about the **sync()** method and the asynchronous nature of Excel JavaScript API, see [Excel JavaScript API core concepts](excel-add-ins-core-concepts.md).

## Best practices

Throughout the code samples in this documentation, you'll notice that every call to `Excel.run` is accompanied by a `catch` statement to catch any errors that occur within the `Excel.run`. We recommend that you use the same pattern when you build an add-in using the Excel JavaScript APIs.

```js
Excel.run(function (context) { 
  
  // Excel JavaScript API calls here

  // Await the completion of context.sync() before continuing.
  return context.sync()
    .then(function () {
	  console.log("Finished!");
    })
}).catch(errorHandlerFunction); 	
```

## API errors 

When an Excel JavaScript API request fails to run successfully, the API returns an error object that contains the following properties: 

- **code**:  The `code` property of an error message contains a string that is part of the `OfficeExtension.ErrorCodes` or `Excel.ErrorCodes` list. For example, the error code "InvalidReference" indicates that the reference is not valid for the specified operation. Error codes are not localized. 

- **message**: The `message` property of an error message contains a summary of the error in the localized string. The error message is not intended for end-user consumption; you should use the error code and appropriate business logic to determine the error message that your add-in shows to end-users.

- **debugInfo**: When present, the `debugInfo` property of the error message provides additional information that you can use to understand the root cause of the error. 

> [!NOTE]
> If you use `console.log()` to print error messages to the console, those messages will only be visible on the server. End-users will not see those error messages in the add-in taskpane or anywhere in the host application.
