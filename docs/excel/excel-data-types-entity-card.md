# Use cards with entity value data types

This article describes how to use the [Excel JavaScript API](../reference/overview/excel-add-ins-reference-overview.md) to create card modal windows in the Excel UI with entity value data types. These cards can display additional information contained within an entity value, beyond what's already visible in a cell, such as related images, product category information, and data attributions.

An entity value, or [EntityCellValue](/javascript/api/excel/excel.entitycellvalue), is a container for data types and similar to an object in object-oriented programming. This article shows how to use entity value card properties, layout options, and data attribution functionality to create entity values that display as cards.

The following screenshot shows an example of an open entity value card, in this case for the **Tofu** product from a list of grocery store products.

## Card properties

The entity value [`properties`](/javascript/api/excel/excel.entitycellvalue#excel-excel-entitycellvalue-properties-member) property allows you to set customized information about your data types. The `properties` key accepts nested data types. Each nested property, or data type, must have a `type` and `basicValue` setting.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The nested `properties` data types are used in combination with the [Card layout](#card-layout) values described in the subsequent article section. After defining a nested data type in `properties`, it must be assigned in the `layouts` property to display on the card.

The following code snippet shows the JSON for an entity value with multiple data types nested within `properties`.

> [!NOTE]
> To see how to use this JSON in a complete code sample, visit the [OfficeDev/office-js-snippets](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js-snippets/blob/main/samples/excel/85-preview-apis/data-types-entity-values.yaml) repository.

```TypeScript
const entity: Excel.EntityCellValue = {
    type: Excel.CellValueType.entity,
    text: productName,
    properties: {
        "Product ID": {
            type: Excel.CellValueType.string,
            basicValue: productID.toString() || ""
        },
        "Product Name": {
            type: Excel.CellValueType.string,
            basicValue: productName || ""
        },
        "Image": {
            type: Excel.CellValueType.webImage,
            address: product.productImage || ""
        },
        "Quantity Per Unit": {
            type: Excel.CellValueType.string,
            basicValue: product.quantityPerUnit || ""
        },
        "Unit Price": {
            type: Excel.CellValueType.formattedNumber,
            basicValue: product.unitPrice,
            numberFormat: "$* #,##0.00"
        },
        Discontinued: {
            type: Excel.CellValueType.boolean,
            basicValue: product.discontinued || false
        }
    },
    layouts: {
        // Enter layout settings here.
    }
};
```

The following screenshot shows an entity value card that uses the preceding code snippet. The screenshot shows the **Product ID**, **Product Name**, **Image**, **Quantity Per Unit**, and **Unit Price** information from the preceding code snippet.

:::image type="content" source="../images/excel-data-types-entity-card-properties.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing an entity value data type with the card layout window displayed. The card shows the product name, product ID, quantity per unit, and unit price information.":::

### Property metadata

Entity properties have an optional `propertyMetadata` field that uses the [`CellValuePropertyMetadata`](/javascript/api/excel/excel.cellvaluepropertymetadata) object and offers the properties `attribution`, `excludeFrom`, and `sublabel`. The following code snippet shows how to add a `sublabel` to the `"Unit Price"` property from the preceding code snippet. In this case, the sublabel identifies the currency type.

> [!NOTE]
> The `propertyMetadata` field is only available on data types that are nested within entity properties.

```TypeScript
// This code snippet is an excerpt from the `properties` field of the 
// preceding `EntityCellValue` snippet. "Unit Price" is a property of 
// an entity value.
        "Unit Price": {
            type: Excel.CellValueType.formattedNumber,
            basicValue: product.unitPrice,
            numberFormat: "$* #,##0.00",
            propertyMetadata: {
              sublabel: "USD"
            }
        },
```

The following screenshot shows an entity value card that uses the preceding code snippet, displaying the property metadata `sublabel` of **USD** next to the **Unit Price** property.

:::image type="content" source="../images/excel-data-types-entity-card-property-metadata.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing the sublabel USD next to the Unit Price.":::

## Card layout

The entity value [`layouts`](/javascript/api/excel/excel.entitycellvalue#excel-excel-entitycellvalue-layouts-member) property creates a [`card`](/javascript/api/excel/excel.entityviewlayouts) for the entity and then specifies the appearance of that card, such as the title of the card, an image for the card, and the number of sections to display.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The nested `layouts` values are used in combination with the [Card properties](#card-properties) data types described in the preceding article section. A nested data type must be defined in `properties` before it can be assigned in `layouts` to display on the card.

Within the `card` property, use the [`CardLayoutStandardProperties`](/javascript/api/excel/excel.cardlayoutstandardproperties) object to define the components of the card like `title`, `subTitle`, and `sections`.

The following entity value JSON code snippet shows a `card` layout with nested `title` and `mainImage` objects, as well as three `sections` within the card. Note that the `title` property `"Product Name"` has a corresponding data type in the preceding [Card properties](#card-properties) article section. The `mainImage` property also has a corresponding `"Image"` data type in the preceding section. The `sections` property takes a nested array and uses the [`CardLayoutSectionStandardProperties`](/javascript/api/excel/excel.cardlayoutsectionstandardproperties) object to define the appearance of each section.

Within each card section you can specify elements like `layout`, `title`, and `properties`. The `layout` key uses the [`CardLayoutListSection`](/javascript/api/excel/excel.cardlayoutlistsection) object and accepts the value `"List"`. The `properties` key accepts an array of strings. Note that the `properties` values, such as `"Product ID"`, have corresponding data types in the preceding [Card properties](#card-properties) article section. Sections can also be collapsible and can be defined with boolean values as collapsed or not collapsed when the entity card is opened in the Excel UI.

```TypeScript
const entity: Excel.EntityCellValue = {
    type: Excel.CellValueType.entity,
    text: productName,
    properties: {
        // Enter property settings here.
    },
    layouts: {
        card: {
            title: { 
                property: "Product Name" 
            },
            mainImage: { 
                property: "Image" 
            },
            sections: [
                {
                    layout: "List",
                    properties: ["Product ID"]
                },
                {
                    layout: "List",
                    title: "Quantity and price",
                    collapsible: true,
                    collapsed: false, // This section will not be collapsed when the card is opened.
                    properties: ["Quantity Per Unit", "Unit Price"]
                },
                {
                    layout: "List",
                    title: "Additional information",
                    collapsible: true,
                    collapsed: true, // This section will be collapsed when the card is opened.
                    properties: ["Discontinued"]
                }
            ]
        }
    }
};
```

The following screenshot shows an entity value card that uses the preceding code snippets. The screenshot shows the `mainImage` object at the top, followed by the `title` object which uses the **Product Name** and is set to **Tofu**. The screenshot also shows `sections`. The **Quantity and price** section is collapsible and contains **Quantity Per Unit** and **Unit Price**. The **Additional information** field is collapsible and is collapsed when the card is opened.

## Card data attribution

Entity value cards can display a data attribution to give credit to the provider of the information in the entity card. The entity value [`provider`](/javascript/api/excel/excel.entitycellvalue#excel-excel-entitycellvalue-provider-member) property uses the [`CellValueProviderAttributes`](/javascript/api/excel/excel.cellvalueproviderattributes) object, which defines the `description`, `logoSourceAddress`, and `logoTargetAddress` values.

The data provider property displays an image in the lower left corner of the entity card. It uses the `logoSourceAddress` to specify a source URL for the image. The `logoTargetAddress` value defines the URL destination if the logo image is selected. The `description` value displays as a tooltip when hovering over the logo. The `description` value also displays as a plain text fallback if the `logoSourceAddress` is not defined or if the source address for the image is broken.

The following JSON code snippet shows an entity value that uses the `provider` property to specify a data provider attribution for the entity.

```TypeScript
const entity: Excel.EntityCellValue = {
    type: Excel.CellValueType.entity,
    text: productName,
    properties: {
        // Enter property settings here.
    },
    layouts: {
        // Enter layout settings here.
    },
    provider: {
        description: product.providerName, // Name of the data provider. Displays as a tooltip when hovering over the logo. Also displays as a fallback if the source address for the image is broken.
        logoSourceAddress: product.sourceAddress, // Source URL of the logo to display.
        logoTargetAddress: product.targetAddress // Destination URL that the logo navigates to when selected.
    }
};
```

The following screenshot shows an entity value card that uses the preceding code snippet. The screenshot shows the data provider attribution in the lower left corner. In this instance, the data provider is Microsoft and the Microsoft logo is displayed.
