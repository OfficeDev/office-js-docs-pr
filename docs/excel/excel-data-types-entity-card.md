# Use cards with cell value data types

You can specify card modal windows in the Excel UI for various cell value data types. Cards can display additional information beyond what's already visible in a cell, such as related images, product category information, and data attributions.

> [!NOTE]
> This article expands on information described in the [Excel data types core concepts](excel-data-types-concepts.md) article. We recommend reading that article before learning about cards for cell values.

Cards are supported for the following cell value types.

- [EntityCellValue](/javascript/api/excel/excel.entitycellvalue)
- [LinkedEntityCellValue](/javascript/api/excel/excel.linkedentitycellvalue)
- **string**, **double**, and **Boolean** basic types

The following screenshot shows an example of an open entity value card, in this case for the **Chef Anton's Gumbo Mix** product from a list of grocery store products.

## Card properties

Use [`properties`](/javascript/api/excel/excel.entitycellvalue#excel-excel-entitycellvalue-properties-member) to specify all custom information about your data types. The `properties` key supports nested data types. Each nested property, or data type, must have a `type` and `basicValue` setting.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The nested `properties` data types are used in combination with the [Card layout](#card-layout) values described in the subsequent article section. After defining a nested data type in `properties`, it must be assigned in the `layouts` property to display on the card.

The following code snippet shows the JSON for an entity value with multiple data types nested within `properties`.

> [!NOTE]
> To experiment with this code snippet in a complete sample, open [Script Lab](../overview/explore-with-script-lab.md) in Excel and select [Data types: Create entity cards from data in a table](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js-snippets/blob/prod/samples/excel/20-data-types/data-types-entity-values.yaml) in our **Samples** library.

```TypeScript
const entity: Excel.EntityCellValue = {
    type: Excel.CellValueType.entity,
    text: productName,
    properties: {
        "Product ID": {
            type: Excel.CellValueType.string,
            basicValue: productID.toString() || ""
        },
        "Product Name": {
            type: Excel.CellValueType.string,
            basicValue: productName || ""
        },
        "Image": {
            type: Excel.CellValueType.webImage,
            address: product.productImage || ""
        },
        "Quantity Per Unit": {
            type: Excel.CellValueType.string,
            basicValue: product.quantityPerUnit || ""
        },
        "Unit Price": {
            type: Excel.CellValueType.double,
            basicValue: product.unitPrice,
            numberFormat: "$* #,##0.00"
        },
        Discontinued: {
            type: Excel.CellValueType.boolean,
            basicValue: product.discontinued || false
        }
    },
    layouts: {
        // Enter layout settings here.
    }
};
```

The following screenshot shows an entity value card that uses the preceding code snippet. The screenshot shows the **Product ID**, **Product Name**, **Image**, **Quantity Per Unit**, and **Unit Price** information from the preceding code snippet.

:::image type="content" source="../images/excel-data-types-entity-card-properties-gumbo.png" alt-text="An entity value data type with the card layout window displayed. The card shows the product name, product ID, quantity per unit, and unit price information.":::

## Card layout

Cell values have a default data type card that the user can view. Specify a custom card layout to improve the user experience when viewing properties. The [`layouts`](/javascript/api/excel/excel.entitycellvalue#excel-excel-entitycellvalue-layouts-member) property defines the structure and appearance of the card. Use `layouts` to specify attributes such as an icon, card title, image for a card, and the number of sections to display.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The nested `layouts` values are used in combination with the [Card properties](#card-properties) data types described in the preceding article section. A nested data type must be defined in `properties` before it can be assigned in `layouts` to display on the card.

The `layouts` property contains two direct subproperties, `compact` and `card`. The `card` property specifies the appearance of a card when the card is open. The `compact` property is optional and defines the icon for a value. The icon is shown in the cell value if it's provided. It can also be shown in the card if it's referenced as a subproperty.

See the [`EntityCompactLayoutIcons`](/javascript/api/excel/excel.entitycompactlayouticons) enum for a full list of available icons. The next code snippet shows how to display the `shoppingBag` icon.

Within the `card` property, use the [`CardLayoutStandardProperties`](/javascript/api/excel/excel.cardlayoutstandardproperties) object to define the components of the card like `title`, `subTitle`, and `sections`.

The entity value JSON in the next code snippet shows a `card` layout with nested `title` and `mainImage` objects, as well as three `sections` within the card. Note that the `title` property `"Product Name"` has a corresponding data type in the preceding [Card properties](#card-properties) article section. The `mainImage` property also has a corresponding `"Image"` data type in the preceding section. The `sections` property takes a nested array and uses the [`CardLayoutSectionStandardProperties`](/javascript/api/excel/excel.cardlayoutsectionstandardproperties) object to define the appearance of each section.

Within each card section you can specify elements like `layout`, `title`, and `properties`. The `layout` key uses the [`CardLayoutListSection`](/javascript/api/excel/excel.cardlayoutlistsection) object and accepts the value `"List"`. The `properties` key accepts an array of strings. Note that the `properties` values, such as `"Product ID"`, have corresponding data types in the preceding [Card properties](#card-properties) article section. Sections can also be collapsible and can be defined with boolean values as collapsed or not collapsed when the entity card is opened in the Excel UI.

```TypeScript
const entity: Excel.EntityCellValue = {
    type: Excel.CellValueType.entity,
    text: productName,
    properties: {
        // Enter property settings here.
    },
    layouts: {
        compact: {
            icon: Excel.EntityCompactLayoutIcons.shoppingBag
        },
        card: {
            title: { 
                property: "Product Name" 
            },
            mainImage: { 
                property: "Image" 
            },
            sections: [
                {
                    layout: "List",
                    properties: ["Product ID"]
                },
                {
                    layout: "List",
                    title: "Quantity and price",
                    collapsible: true,
                    collapsed: false, // This section will not be collapsed when the card is opened.
                    properties: ["Quantity Per Unit", "Unit Price"]
                },
                {
                    layout: "List",
                    title: "Additional information",
                    collapsible: true,
                    collapsed: true, // This section will be collapsed when the card is opened.
                    properties: ["Discontinued"]
                }
            ]
        }
    }
};
```

The following screenshot shows an entity value card that uses the preceding code snippets. In the screenshot, the `shoppingBag` icon displays alongside the product names in the spreadsheet. In the entity card, the `mainImage` object displays at the top, followed by the `title` object which uses the **Product Name** and is set to **Chef Anton's Gumbo Mix**. The screenshot also shows `sections`. The **Quantity and price** section is collapsible and contains **Quantity Per Unit** and **Unit Price**. The **Additional information** field is collapsible and is collapsed when the card is opened.

> [!NOTE]
> In the preceding screenshot, the `branch` icon displays alongside **Condiments** in the **Category** section. See the [Data types: Create entity cards from data in a table](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-js-snippets/blob/prod/samples/excel/20-data-types/data-types-entity-values.yaml) sample to learn how to set nested icons like the **Category** section icon.
>
> There is a known issue with nested icons in Excel on Mac. In that environment, nested icons will always display as the `generic` icon, regardless of which icon is selected with the `EntityCompactLayoutIcons` enum.

### Property metadata

Entity properties have an optional `propertyMetadata` field that uses the [`CellValuePropertyMetadata`](/javascript/api/excel/excel.cellvaluepropertymetadata) object and offers the properties `attribution`, `excludeFrom`, and `sublabel`. The following code snippet shows how to add a `sublabel` to the `"Unit Price"` property from the preceding code snippet. In this case, the sublabel identifies the currency type.

> [!NOTE]
> The `propertyMetadata` field is only available on data types that are nested within entity properties.

```TypeScript
// This code snippet is an excerpt from the `properties` field of the 
// preceding `EntityCellValue` snippet. "Unit Price" is a property of 
// an entity value.
    "Unit Price": {
        type: Excel.CellValueType.double,
        basicValue: product.unitPrice,
        numberFormat: "$* #,##0.00",
        propertyMetadata: {
          sublabel: "USD"
        }
    },
```

## Attribution

Add attribution for information that comes from third parties to indicate the source and any license information. Use [Excel.CellValueAttributionAttributes](/javascript/api/excel/excel.cellvalueattributionattributes) to add attribution to a cell value. The following code example shows how to add attribution for usage of information about the planet Mars from Wikipedia.

```javascript
async function createPlanet() {
    await Excel.run(async (context) => {
        const sheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getActiveWorksheet();
        const range = sheet.getRange("A1");
        const attributionObject: Excel.CellValueAttributionAttributes = {
            licenseAddress: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_free_content",
            licenseText: "Free usage information",
            sourceAddress: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars",
            sourceText: "Wikipedia"
        };

        range.valuesAsJson = [
            [
                {
                    type: Excel.CellValueType.double,
                    basicType: Excel.RangeValueType.double,
                    basicValue: 6779, // kilometers (radius)
                    properties: {
                        Name: {
                            type: Excel.CellValueType.string,
                            basicType: Excel.RangeValueType.string,
                            basicValue: "Mars",
                            propertyMetadata: {
                                sublabel: "Planetary Body",
                                attribution: [attributionObject]
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            ]
        ];
        await context.sync();
    });
}
```

The following image shows how the attribution is displayed in the data type card for the user.

## Provider information

You can add information about your add-in, or service, that is the source for the information in the data type card. Use [Excel.CellValueProviderAttributes](/javascript/api/excel/excel.cellvalueproviderattributes) to add your provider information. The following code sample shows how to add provider information for Contoso generic search as the source of search data for the cell value.

```javascript
async function createSearchEntry() {
    await Excel.run(async (context) => {
        const sheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getActiveWorksheet();
        const range = sheet.getRange("A1");

        range.valuesAsJson = [
            [
                {
                    type: Excel.CellValueType.string,
                    basicType: Excel.RangeValueType.string,
                    basicValue: "cell function - Microsoft support",
                    properties: {
                        "Search Keywords": {
                            type: Excel.CellValueType.string,
                            basicType: Excel.RangeValueType.string,
                            basicValue: "Cell Values"
                        }
                    },
                    provider: {
                        description: "Contoso generic search",
                        // Image credit: Ignacio javier igjav, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons
                        logoSourceAddress: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Lupa.png",
                        logoTargetAddress: "https://contoso.com"
                    }
                }
            ]
        ];

        await context.sync();
    });
}
```

The following image shows how the provider information appears as the logo in the data type card for the user.
