# Get started with Excel add-ins

You can create an Excel add-in using familiar web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## Create your first Excel add-in

To get started, complete one of the walkthroughs in this section to create an Excel add-in using [React](excel-add-ins-get-started-react.md), [Angular](excel-add-ins-get-started-angular.md), or [jQuery](excel-add-ins-get-started-jquery.md). Each walkthough provides step-by-step guidance for creating a simple task pane add-in that uses the Excel JavaScript API to interact with a worksheet. 

## Explore snippets with Script Lab

Script Lab is a tool that enables you to create, run, and share your Office Add-in code directly from Office applications such as Excel, Word, and PowerPoint. You can [install Script Lab for free from the Office Store](https://store.office.com/app.aspx?assetid=WA104380862) and launch it in Excel to explore its collection of built-in samples that interact with data in the workbook. Then, use it to write and execute your own Excel JavaScript API code that interacts with your spreadsheet. For more information, see [Script Lab, a Microsoft Garage project](https://github.com/OfficeDev/script-lab/blob/master/README.md).
