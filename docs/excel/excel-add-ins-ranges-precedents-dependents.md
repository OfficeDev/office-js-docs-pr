# Get formula precedents and dependents using the Excel JavaScript API

Excel formulas often refer to other cells. These cross-cell references are known as "precedents" and "dependents". A precedent is a cell that provides data to a formula. A dependent is a cell that contains a formula that refers to other cells. To learn more about Excel features related to relationships between cells, see [Display the relationships between formulas and cells](https://support.microsoft.com/office/display-the-relationships-between-formulas-and-cells-a59bef2b-3701-46bf-8ff1-d3518771d507).

A cell may have a precedent cell, and that precedent cell may have its own precedent cells. A "direct precedent" is the first preceding group of cells in this sequence, similar to the concept of parents in a parent-child relationship. A "direct dependent" is the first dependent group of cells in a sequence, similar to children in a parent-child relationship. Cells that refer to other cells in a workbook, but whose relationship is not a parent-child relationship, are not direct dependents or direct precedents.

This article provides code samples that retrieve direct precedents and direct dependents of formulas using the Excel JavaScript API. For the complete list of properties and methods that the `Range` object supports, see [Range Object (JavaScript API for Excel)](/javascript/api/excel/excel.range).

## Get the direct precedents of a formula

Locate a formula's direct precedent cells with [Range.getDirectPrecedents](/javascript/api/excel/excel.range#getdirectprecedents--). `Range.getDirectPrecedents` returns a `WorkbookRangeAreas` object. This object contains the addresses of all the direct precedents in the workbook. It has a separate `RangeAreas` object for each worksheet containing at least one formula precedent. For more information on working with the `RangeAreas` object, see [Work with multiple ranges simultaneously in Excel add-ins](excel-add-ins-multiple-ranges.md).

The following screenshot shows the result of selecting the **Trace Precedents** button in the Excel UI. This button draws an arrow from precedent cells to the selected cell. The selected cell, **E3**, contains the formula "=C3 * D3", so both **C3** and **D3** are precedent cells. Unlike the Excel UI button, the `getDirectPrecedents` method does not draw arrows.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `getDirectPrecedents` method can't retrieve precedent cells across workbooks.

The following code sample gets the direct precedents for the active range and then changes the background color of those precedent cells to yellow.

```js
Excel.run(function (context) {
    // Precedents are cells that provide data to the selected formula.
    var range = context.workbook.getActiveCell();
    var directPrecedents = range.getDirectPrecedents();
    range.load("address");
    directPrecedents.areas.load("address");
    
    return context.sync()
        .then(function () {
            console.log(`Direct precedentâ€¯cells of ${range.address}:`);

            // Use the direct precedents API to loop through precedents of the active cell.
            for (var i = 0; i < directPrecedents.areas.items.length; i++) {
              // Highlight and print out the address of each precedent cell.
              directPrecedents.areas.items[i].format.fill.color = "Yellow";
              console.log(`  ${directPrecedents.areas.items[i].address}`);
            }
        });
}).catch(errorHandlerFunction);
```

## Get the direct dependents of a formula

Locate a formula's direct dependent cells with [Range.getDirectDependents](/javascript/api/excel/excel.range#getDirectDependents__). Like `Range.getDirectPrecedents`, `Range.getDirectDependents` also returns a `WorkbookRangeAreas` object. This object contains the addresses of all the direct dependents in the workbook. It has a separate `RangeAreas` object for each worksheet containing at least one formula dependent. For more information on working with the `RangeAreas` object, see [Work with multiple ranges simultaneously in Excel add-ins](excel-add-ins-multiple-ranges.md).

The following screenshot shows the result of selecting the **Trace Dependents** button in the Excel UI. This button draws an arrow from dependent cells to the selected cell. The selected cell, **D3**, has cell **E3** as a dependent. **E3** contains the formula "=C3 * D3". Unlike the Excel UI button, the `getDirectDependents` method does not draw arrows.

    var range = context.workbook.getActiveCell();
    var directDependents = range.getDirectDependents();
    range.load("address");
    directDependents.areas.load("address");
    
    return context.sync()
        .then(function () {
            console.log(`Direct dependent cells of ${range.address}:`);
    
            // Use the direct dependents API to loop through direct dependents of the active cell.
            for (var i = 0; i < directDependents.areas.items.length; i++) {
              // Highlight and print the address of each dependent cell.
              directDependents.areas.items[i].format.fill.color = "Yellow";
              console.log(`  ${directDependents.areas.items[i].address}`);
            }
        });
}).catch(errorHandlerFunction);
```
