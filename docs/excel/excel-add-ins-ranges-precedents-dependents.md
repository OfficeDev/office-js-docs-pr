# Get formula precedents and dependents using the Excel JavaScript API

Excel formulas often refer to other cells. These cross-cell references are known as "precedents" and "dependents". A precedent is a cell that provides data to a formula. A dependent is a cell that contains a formula that refers to other cells. To learn more about Excel features related to relationships between cells, see [Display the relationships between formulas and cells](https://support.microsoft.com/office/display-the-relationships-between-formulas-and-cells-a59bef2b-3701-46bf-8ff1-d3518771d507).

This article provides code samples that retrieve formula precedents and formula dependents using the Excel JavaScript API. For the complete list of properties and methods that the `Range` object supports, see [Range Object (JavaScript API for Excel)](/javascript/api/excel/excel.range).

## Get the direct precedents of a formula

Locate a formula's direct precedent cells with [Range.getDirectPrecedents](/javascript/api/excel/excel.range#getdirectprecedents--). `Range.getDirectPrecedents` returns a `WorkbookRangeAreas` object. This object contains the addresses of all the direct precedents in the workbook. It has a separate `RangeAreas` object for each worksheet containing at least one formula precedent. For more information on working with the `RangeAreas` object, see [Work with multiple ranges simultaneously in Excel add-ins](excel-add-ins-multiple-ranges.md).

In the Excel UI, the **Trace Precedents** button draws an arrow from precedent cells to the selected formula. Unlike the Excel UI button, the `getDirectPrecedents` method does not draw arrows.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `getDirectPrecedents` method can't retrieve precedent cells across workbooks.

The following code sample gets the direct precedents for the active range and then changes the background color of those precedent cells to yellow.

```js
Excel.run(function (context) {
    // Precedents are cells that provide data to the selected formula.
    var range = context.workbook.getActiveCell();
    var directPrecedents = range.getDirectPrecedents();
    range.load("address");
    directPrecedents.areas.load("address");
    
    return context.sync()
        .then(function () {
            console.log(`Direct precedentâ€¯cells of ${range.address}:`);

            // Use the direct precedents API to loop through precedents of the active cell.
            for (var i = 0; i < directPrecedents.areas.items.length; i++) {
              // Highlight and print out the address of each precedent cell.
              directPrecedents.areas.items[i].format.fill.color = "Yellow";
              console.log(`  ${directPrecedents.areas.items[i].address}`);
            }
        })
}).catch(errorHandlerFunction);
```

## Get the direct dependents of a formula (preview)

> [!NOTE]
> The `Range.getDirectDependents` method is currently only available in public preview. [!INCLUDE [Information about using preview APIs](../includes/using-excel-preview-apis.md)]
> 

Locate a formula's direct dependent cells with [Range.getDirectDependents](/javascript/api/excel/excel.range#getDirectDependents__). Like `Range.getDirectPrecedents`, `Range.getDirectDependents` also returns a `WorkbookRangeAreas` object. This object contains the addresses of all the direct dependents in the workbook. It has a separate `RangeAreas` object for each worksheet containing at least one formula dependent. For more information on working with the `RangeAreas` object, see [Work with multiple ranges simultaneously in Excel add-ins](excel-add-ins-multiple-ranges.md).

In the Excel UI, the **Trace Dependents** button draws an arrow from dependent cells to the selected formula. Unlike the Excel UI button, the `getDirectDependents` method does not draw arrows.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `getDirectDependents` method can't retrieve dependent cells across workbooks.

The following code sample gets the direct dependents for the active range and then changes the background color of those dependent cells to yellow.

```js
Excel.run(function (context) {
    // Direct dependents are cells that contain formulas that refer to other cells.
    var range = context.workbook.getActiveCell();
    var directDependents = range.getDirectDependents();
    range.load("address");
    directDependents.areas.load("address");
    
    return context.sync()
        .then(function () {
            console.log(`Direct dependent cells of ${range.address}:`);
    
            // Use the direct dependents API to loop through direct dependents of the active cell.
            for (var i = 0; i < directDependents.areas.items.length; i++) {
              // Highlight and print the address of each dependent cell.
              directDependents.areas.items[i].format.fill.color = "Yellow";
              console.log(`  ${directDependents.areas.items[i].address}`);
            }
        })
}).catch(errorHandlerFunction);
```
