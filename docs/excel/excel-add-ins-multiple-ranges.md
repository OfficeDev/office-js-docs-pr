# Work with multiple ranges simultaneously in Excel add-ins (Preview)

The Excel JavaScript library enables your add-in to perform operations, and set properties, on multiple ranges simultaneously. The ranges do not have to be contiguous. In addition to making your code simpler, this way of setting a property runs much faster than setting the same property individually for each of the ranges.

> [!NOTE]
> The APIs described in this article require **Office 2016 Click-to-Run version 1809 Build 10820.20000** or later. (You may need to join the [Office Insider program](https://products.office.com/office-insider) to get an appropriate build.) Also, you must load the beta version of the Office JavaScript library from [Office.js CDN](https://appsforoffice.microsoft.com/lib/beta/hosted/office.js). Finally, we don't have reference pages for these APIs yet. But the following definition type file has descriptions for them: [beta office.d.ts](https://appsforoffice.microsoft.com/lib/beta/hosted/office.d.ts).

## RangeAreas

A set of (possibly discontiguous) ranges is represented by an `Excel.RangeAreas` object. It has properties and methods similar to the `Range` type (many with the same, or similar, names), but adjustments have been made to:

- The data types for properties and the behavior of the setters and getters.
- The data types of method parameters and the method behaviors.
- The data types of method return values.

Some examples:

- `RangeAreas` has an `address` property that returns a comma-delimited string of range addresses, instead of just one address as with the `Range.address` property.
- `RangeAreas` has a `dataValidation` property that returns a `DataValidation` object that represents the data validation of all the ranges in the `RangeAreas`, if it is consistent. The property is `null` if identical `DataValidation` objects are not applied to all the all the ranges in the `RangeAreas`. This is a general, but not universal, principle with the `RangeAreas` object: *If a property does not have consistent values on all the all the ranges in the `RangeAreas`, then it is `null`.* See [Reading properties of RangeAreas](#reading-properties-of-rangeareas) for more information and some exceptions.
- `RangeAreas.cellCount` gets the total number of cells in all the ranges in the `RangeAreas`.
- `RangeAreas.calculate` recalculates the cells of all the ranges in the `RangeAreas`.
- `RangeAreas.getEntireColumn` and `RangeAreas.getEntireRow` return another `RangeAreas` object that represents all of the columns (or rows) in all the ranges in the `RangeAreas`. For example, if the `RangeAreas` represents "A1:C4" and "F14:L15", then `RangeAreas.getEntireColumn` returns a `RangeAreas` object that represents "A:C" and "F:L".
- `RangeAreas.copyFrom` can take either a `Range` or a `RangeAreas` parameter representing the source range(s) of the copy operation.

### RangeArea-specific properties and methods

The `RangeAreas` type has some properties and methods that are not on the `Range` object. The following is a selection of them:

- `areas`: A `RangeCollection` object that contains all of the ranges represented by the `RangeAreas` object. The `RangeCollection` object is also new and is similar to other Excel collection objects. It has an `items` property which is an array of `Range` objects representing the ranges.
- `areaCount`: The total number of ranges in the `RangeAreas`.
- `getOffsetRangeAreas`: Works just like [Range.getOffsetRange](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/excel/excel.range#getoffsetrange-rowoffset--columnoffset-), except that a `RangeAreas` is returned and it contains ranges that are each offset from one of the ranges in the original `RangeAreas`.

## Create RangeAreas and set properties

You can create `RangeAreas` object in two basic ways:

- Call `Worksheet.getRanges()` and pass it a string with comma-delimited range addresses. If any range you want to include has been made into a [NamedItem](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/excel/excel.nameditem), you can include the name, instead of the address, in the string.
- Call `Workbook.getSelectedRanges()`. This method returns a `RangeAreas` representing all the ranges that are selected on the currently active worksheet.

Once you have a `RangeAreas` object, you can create others using the methods on the object that return `RangeAreas` such as `getOffsetRangeAreas` and `getIntersection`.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot directly add additional ranges to a `RangeAreas` object. For example, the collection in `RangeAreas.areas` does not have an `add` method.


> [!WARNING] 
> Do not attempt to directly add or delete members of the the `RangeAreas.areas.items` array. This will lead to undesirable behavior in your code. For example, it is possible to push an additional `Range` object onto the array, but doing so will cause errors because `RangeAreas` properties and methods behave as if the new item isn't there. For example, the `areaCount` property does not include ranges pushed in this way, and the `RangeAreas.getItemAt(index)` throws an error if `index` is larger than `areasCount-1`. Similarly, deleting a `Range` object in the `RangeAreas.areas.items` array by getting a reference to it and calling its `Range.delete` method causes bugs: although the `Range` object *is* deleted, the properties and methods of the parent `RangeAreas` object behave, or try to, as if it is still in existence. For example, if your code calls `RangeAreas.calculate`, Office will try to calculate the range, but will error because the range object is gone.

Setting a property on a `RangeAreas` sets the corresponding property on all the ranges in the `RangeAreas.areas` collection.

The following is an example of setting a property on multiple ranges. The function highlights the ranges **F3:F5** and **H3:H5**.

```js
Excel.run(function (context) {
    const sheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getActiveWorksheet();
    const rangeAreas = sheet.getRanges("F3:F5, H3:H5");
    rangeAreas.format.fill.color = "pink";

    return context.sync();
})
```

This example applies to scenarios in which you can hard code the range addresses that you pass to `getRanges` or easily calculate them at runtime. Some of the scenarios in which this would be true include: 

- The code runs in the context of a known template.
- The code runs in the context of imported data where the schema of the data is known.

When you can't know at coding-time which ranges you need to operate on, you must discover them at runtime. The next section discusses these scenarios.

### Discover range areas programmatically

The `Range.getSpecialCells()` and `Range.getSpecialCellsOrNullObject()` methods enable you to find at runtime the ranges that you want to operate on based on the characteristics of the cells and the type of the values of the cells. Here are the signatures of the methods from the TypeScript data types file:

```typescript
getSpecialCells(cellType: Excel.SpecialCellType, cellValueType?: Excel.SpecialCellValueType): Excel.RangeAreas;
```

```typescript
getSpecialCellsOrNullObject(cellType: Excel.SpecialCellType, cellValueType?: Excel.SpecialCellValueType): Excel.RangeAreas;
```

The following is an example of using the first one. About this code, note:

- It limits the part of the sheet that needs to be searched by first calling `Worksheet.getUsedRange` and calling `getSpecialCells` for only that range.
- It passes as a parameter to `getSpecialCells` the string version of a value from the `Excel.SpecialCellType` enum. Some of the other values that could be passed instead are "Blanks" for empty cells, "Constants" for cells with literal values instead of formulas, and "SameConditionalFormat" for cells that have the same conditional formatting as the first cell in the `usedRange`. The first cell is the upper leftmost cell. For a complete list of the values in the enum, see [beta office.d.ts](https://appsforoffice.microsoft.com/lib/beta/hosted/office.d.ts).
- The `getSpecialCells` method returns a `RangeAreas` object, so all of the cells with formulas will be colored pink even if they are not all contiguous. 

```js
Excel.run(function (context) {
    const sheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getActiveWorksheet();
    const usedRange = sheet.getUsedRange();
    const formulaRanges = usedRange.getSpecialCells("Formulas");
    formulaRanges.format.fill.color = "pink";

    return context.sync();
})
```

Sometimes the range doesn't have *any* cells with the targeted characteristic. If `getSpecialCells` doesn't find any, it throws an **ItemNotFound** error. This would divert the flow of control to a `catch` block/method, if there is one. If there isn't, the error halts the function. There may be scenarios in which throwing the error is exactly what you want to happen when there are no cells with the targeted characteristic. 

But in scenarios in which it is normal, but perhaps uncommon, for there to be no matching cells; your code should check for this possibility and handle it gracefully without throwing an error. For these scenarios, use the `getSpecialCellsOrNullObject` method and test the `RangeAreas.isNullObject` property. The following is an example. Note about this code:

- The `getSpecialCellsOrNullObject` method always returns a proxy object, so it is never `null` in the ordinary JavaScript sense. But if no matching cells are found, the `isNullObject` property of the object is set to `true`.
- It calls `context.sync` *before* it tests the `isNullObject` property. This is a requirement with all `*OrNullObject` methods and properties, because you always have to load and sync a property in order to read it. However, it is not necessary to *explicitly* load the `isNullObject` property. It is automatically loaded by the `context.sync` even if `load` is not called on the object. For more information, see [\*OrNullObject](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/excel/excel-add-ins-advanced-concepts#42ornullobject-methods).
- You can test this code by first selecting a range that has no formula cells and running it. Then select a range that has at least one cell with a formula and run it again.

```js
Excel.run(function (context) {
    const range = context.workbook.getSelectedRange();
    const formulaRanges = range.getSpecialCellsOrNullObject("Formulas");
    return context.sync()
        .then(function() {
            if (formulaRanges.isNullObject) {
                console.log("No cells have formulas");
            }
            else {
                formulaRanges.format.fill.color = "pink";
            }
        })
        .then(context.sync);
})
```

For simplicity, all other examples in this article use the `getSpecialCells` method instead of  `getSpecialCellsOrNullObject`.

#### Narrow the target cells with cell value types

There is an optional second parameter, of enum type `Excel.SpecialCellValueType`, that further narrows down the cells to target. You can use it only when you pass either "Formulas" or "Constants" to `getSpecialCells` or `getSpecialCellsOrNullObject`. The parameter specifies that you only want cells with certain types of values. There are four basic types: "Error", "Logical" (which means boolean), "Numbers", and "Text". (The enum has other values besides these four which are discussed below.) The following is an example. About this code, note:

- It will only highlight cells that have a literal number value. It will not highlight cells that have a formula (even if the result is a number) or a boolean, text, or error state cells.
- To test the code, be sure the worksheet has some cells with literal number values, some with other kinds of literal values, and some with formulas.

```js
Excel.run(function (context) {
    const sheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getActiveWorksheet();
    const usedRange = sheet.getUsedRange();
    const constantNumberRanges = usedRange.getSpecialCells("Constants", "Numbers");
    constantNumberRanges.format.fill.color = "pink";

    return context.sync();
})
```

Sometimes you need to operate on more than one cell value type, such as all text-valued and all boolean-valued ("Logical") cells. The `Excel.SpecialCellValueType` enum has values that let you combine types. For example, "LogicalText" will target all boolean and all text-valued cells. You can combine any two or any three of the four basic types. The names of these enum values that combine basic types are always in alphabetical order. So to combine error-valued, text-valued, and boolean-valued cells, use "ErrorLogicalText", not "LogicalErrorText" or "TextErrorLogical". The default parameter of "All" combines all four types. The following example highlights all cells with formulas that produce number or boolean values:

```js
Excel.run(function (context) {
    const sheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getActiveWorksheet();
    const usedRange = sheet.getUsedRange();
    const formulaLogicalNumberRanges = usedRange.getSpecialCells("Formulas", "LogicalNumbers");
    formulaLogicalNumberRanges.format.fill.color = "pink";

    return context.sync();
})
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `Excel.SpecialCellValueType` parameter can only be used if the `Excel.SpecialCellType` parameter is "Formulas" or "Constants".

### Get RangeAreas within RangeAreas

The `RangeAreas` type itself also has `getSpecialCells` and `getSpecialCellsOrNullObject` methods which take the same two parameters. These methods return all the targeted cells from all of the ranges in the `RangeAreas.areas` collection. There is one small difference in the behavior of the methods when called on a `RangeAreas` object instead of a `Range` object: when you pass "SameConditionalFormat" as the first parameter, the method returns all cells that have the same conditional formatting as the upper leftmost cell *in the first range in the `RangeAreas.areas` collection*. The same point applies to "SameDataValidation": when passed to `Range.getSpecialCells`, it returns all cells that have the same data validation rule as the upper leftmost cell *in the range*. But when it is passed to `RangeAreas.getSpecialCells`, it returns all cells that have the same data validation rule as the upper leftmost cell *in the first range in the `RangeAreas.areas` collection*.

## Read properties of RangeAreas

Reading property values of `RangeAreas` requires care, because a given property may have different values for different ranges within the `RangeAreas`. The general rule is that if a consistent value *can* be returned it will be returned. For example, in the following code, The RGB code for pink (`#FFC0CB`) and `true` will be logged to the console because both the ranges in the `RangeAreas` object have a pink fill and both are entire columns.

```js
Excel.run(function (context) {
    const sheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getActiveWorksheet();

    // The ranges are the F column and the H column.
    const rangeAreas = sheet.getRanges("F:F, H:H");  
    rangeAreas.format.fill.color = "pink";

    rangeAreas.load("format/fill/color, isEntireColumn");

    return context.sync()
        .then(function () {
            console.log(rangeAreas.format.fill.color); // #FFC0CB
            console.log(rangeAreas.isEntireColumn); // true
        })
        .then(context.sync);
})
```

Things get more complicated when consistency isn't possible. The behavior of `RangeAreas` properties follows these three principles:

- A boolean property of a `RangeAreas` object returns `false` unless the property is true for all the member ranges.
- Non-boolean properties, with the exception of the `address` property, return `null` unless the corresponding property on all the member ranges has the same value.
- The `address` property returns a comma-delimited string of the addresses of the member ranges.

For example, the following code creates a `RangeAreas` in which only one range is an entire column and only one is filled with pink. The console will show `null` for the fill color, `false` for the `isEntireRow` property, and "Sheet1!F3:F5, Sheet1!H:H" (assuming the sheet name is "Sheet1") for the `address` property. 

```js
Excel.run(function (context) {
    const sheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getActiveWorksheet();
    const rangeAreas = sheet.getRanges("F3:F5, H:H");

    const pinkColumnRange = sheet.getRange("H:H");
    pinkColumnRange.format.fill.color = "pink";

    rangeAreas.load("format/fill/color, isEntireColumn, address");

    return context.sync()
        .then(function () {
            console.log(rangeAreas.format.fill.color); // null
            console.log(rangeAreas.isEntireColumn); // false
            console.log(rangeAreas.address); // "Sheet1!F3:F5, Sheet1!H:H"
        })
        .then(context.sync);
})
```
