# Add data validation to Excel ranges

Use the Excel JavaScript API to enforce data quality. Apply rules and rely on Excel’s validation UI for prompts and error alerts. This article shows how to define rule types, configure prompts and error alerts, and remove or adjust validation. If you need background on Excel’s built-in validation UI, review these articles.

## Programmatic control of data validation

The `Range.dataValidation` property, which takes a [DataValidation](/javascript/api/excel/excel.datavalidation) object, is the entry point for programmatic control of data validation in Excel. The object has five properties:

- `rule` &#8212; Defines what constitutes valid data for the range. See [DataValidationRule](/javascript/api/excel/excel.datavalidationrule).
- `errorAlert` &#8212; Specifies whether an error pops up if the user enters invalid data, and defines the alert text, title, and style such as `information`, `warning`, and `stop`. See [DataValidationErrorAlert](/javascript/api/excel/excel.datavalidationerroralert).
- `prompt` &#8212; Specifies whether a prompt appears when the user hovers over the range and defines the prompt message. See [DataValidationPrompt](/javascript/api/excel/excel.datavalidationprompt).
- `ignoreBlanks` &#8212; Specifies whether the data validation rule applies to blank cells in the range. Defaults to `true`.
- `type` &#8212; A read-only identification of the validation type, such as WholeNumber, Date, TextLength, etc. It is set indirectly when you set the `rule` property.

> [!NOTE]
> Data validation added programmatically behaves just like manually added data validation. In particular, note that data validation is triggered only if the user directly enters a value into a cell or copies and pastes a cell from elsewhere in the workbook and chooses the **Values** paste option. If the user copies a cell and does a plain paste into a range with data validation, validation is not triggered.

## Create validation rules

To add data validation to a range, your code must set the `rule` property of the `DataValidation` object in `Range.dataValidation`. This takes a [DataValidationRule](/javascript/api/excel/excel.datavalidationrule) object which has seven optional properties. *No more than one of these properties may be present in any `DataValidationRule` object.* The property that you include determines the type of validation.

### Basic and DateTime validation rule types

The first three `DataValidationRule` properties (i.e., validation rule types) take a [BasicDataValidation](/javascript/api/excel/excel.basicdatavalidation) object as their value.

- `wholeNumber` &#8212; Requires a whole number in addition to any other validation specified by the `BasicDataValidation` object.
- `decimal` &#8212; Requires a decimal number in addition to any other validation specified by the `BasicDataValidation` object.
- `textLength` &#8212; Applies the validation details in the `BasicDataValidation` object to the *length* of the cell's value.

The following example creates a validation rule. Key points:

- The `operator` is the binary operator `greaterThan`. Whenever you use a binary operator, the value that the user tries to enter in the cell is the left-hand operand and the value specified in `formula1` is the right-hand operand. This rule says that only whole numbers greater than 0 are valid.
- The `formula1` is a hard-coded number. If you don't know at coding time what the value should be, you can also use an Excel formula as a string (such as "=A3" or "=SUM(A4,B5)").

```js
await Excel.run(async (context) => {
    let sheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getActiveWorksheet();
    let range = sheet.getRange("B2:C5");

    range.dataValidation.rule = {
            wholeNumber: {
                formula1: 0,
                operator: Excel.DataValidationOperator.greaterThan
            }
        };

    await context.sync();
});
```

See [BasicDataValidation](/javascript/api/excel/excel.basicdatavalidation) for other binary operators.

There are also two ternary operators: `between` and `notBetween`. To use these, specify the optional `formula2` property. The `formula1` and `formula2` values are the bounding operands. The value that the user tries to enter in the cell is the third (evaluated) operand. The following is an example of using the "Between" operator.

```js
await Excel.run(async (context) => {
    let sheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getActiveWorksheet();
    let range = sheet.getRange("B2:C5");

    range.dataValidation.rule = {
            decimal: {
                formula1: 0,
                formula2: 100,
              operator: Excel.DataValidationOperator.between
            }
        };

    await context.sync();
});
```

The next two rule properties take a [DateTimeDataValidation](/javascript/api/excel/excel.datetimedatavalidation) object as their value.

- `date`
- `time`

The `DateTimeDataValidation` object is structured similarly to the `BasicDataValidation`: it has the properties `formula1`, `formula2`, and `operator`, and is used in the same way. The difference is that you cannot use a number in the formula properties, but you can enter a [ISO 8606 datetime](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) string (or an Excel formula). The following is an example that defines valid values as dates in the first week of April, 2022.

```js
await Excel.run(async (context) => {
    let sheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getActiveWorksheet();
    let range = sheet.getRange("B2:C5");

    range.dataValidation.rule = {
            date: {
                formula1: "2022-04-01",
                formula2: "2022-04-08",
                operator: Excel.DataValidationOperator.between
            }
        };

    await context.sync();
});
```

### List validation rule type

Use the `list` property in the `DataValidationRule` object to constrain values to a finite set. The following code sample demonstrates. Key points:

- It assumes that there is a worksheet named "Names" and that the values in the range "A1:A3" are names.
- The `source` property specifies the list of valid values. The string argument refers to a range containing the names. You can also assign a comma-delimited list such as "Sue, Ricky, Liz".
- The `inCellDropDown` property specifies whether a drop-down control appears in the cell when the user selects it. If `true`, the drop-down appears with the list of values from the `source`.

```js
await Excel.run(async (context) => {
    let sheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getActiveWorksheet();
    let range = sheet.getRange("B2:C5");   
    let nameSourceRange = context.workbook.worksheets.getItem("Names").getRange("A1:A3");

    range.dataValidation.rule = {
        list: {
            inCellDropDown: true,
            source: "=Names!$A$1:$A$3"
        }
    };

    await context.sync();
})
```

### Custom validation rule type

Use the `custom` property to specify a custom validation formula. The following is an example. Key points:

- It assumes a there is two-column table with columns **Athlete Name** and **Comments** in the A and B columns of the worksheet.
- To reduce verbosity in the **Comments** column, the rule makes data that includes the athlete's name invalid.
- `SEARCH(A2,B2)` returns the starting position in B2 of the string in A2. If A2 isn't contained in B2, it doesn't return a number. 
- `ISNUMBER()` returns a boolean. So the `formula` property says that valid data for **Comments** is data that doesn't include the **Athlete Name** string.

```js
await Excel.run(async (context) => {
    let sheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getActiveWorksheet();
    let commentsRange = sheet.tables.getItem("AthletesTable").columns.getItem("Comments").getDataBodyRange();

    commentsRange.dataValidation.rule = {
            custom: {
                formula: "=NOT(ISNUMBER(SEARCH(A2,B2)))"
            }
        };

    await context.sync();
});
```

## Create validation error alerts

Create an error alert to guide the user when invalid data is entered. The following example creates a basic alert. Key points:

- The `style` property determines whether the user gets an informational alert, a warning, or a "stop" alert. Only `stop` actually prevents the user from adding invalid data. The pop-ups for `warning` and `information` have options that allow the user enter the invalid data anyway.
- The `showAlert` property defaults to `true`. This means that Excel will pop-up a generic alert (of type `stop`) unless you create a custom alert which either sets `showAlert` to `false` or sets a custom message, title, and style. This code sets a custom message and title.

```js
await Excel.run(async (context) => {
    let sheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getActiveWorksheet();
    let range = sheet.getRange("B2:C5");

    range.dataValidation.errorAlert = {
            message: "Sorry, only positive whole numbers are allowed",
            showAlert: true, // The default is 'true'.
              style: Excel.DataValidationAlertStyle.stop,
            title: "Negative or Decimal Number Entered"
        };

    // Set range.dataValidation.rule and optionally .prompt here.

    await context.sync();
});
```

For more information, see [DataValidationErrorAlert](/javascript/api/excel/excel.datavalidationerroralert).

## Create validation prompts

Create an instructional prompt that appears when the user selects the cell. This example tells the user about the positive number validation before they enter data.

```js
await Excel.run(async (context) => {
    let sheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getActiveWorksheet();
    let range = sheet.getRange("B2:C5");

    range.dataValidation.prompt = {
            message: "Please enter a positive whole number.",
            showPrompt: true, // The default is 'false'.
            title: "Positive Whole Numbers Only."
        };

    // Set range.dataValidation.rule and optionally .errorAlert here.

    await context.sync();
});
```

For more information, see [DataValidationPrompt](/javascript/api/excel/excel.datavalidationprompt).

## Remove data validation from a range

To remove data validation from a range, call the  [Range.dataValidation.clear()](/javascript/api/excel/excel.datavalidation#excel-excel-datavalidation-clear-member(1)) method.

```js
myrange.dataValidation.clear();
```

The range you clear doesn’t need to precisely match the range on which you added data validation. If the two ranges aren't an exact match, only overlapping cells are cleared.

> [!NOTE]
> Clearing data validation from a range will also clear any data validation that a user has added manually to the range.

## Next steps

- Combine validation with events: [Events](excel-add-ins-events.md).
- Add conditional formatting for stronger visual cues.
