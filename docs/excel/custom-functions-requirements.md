# Custom functions requirements

Custom functions are currently available in developer preview on the following platforms:

- Excel Online
- Excel for Windows (version 1810 or later) 
- Excel for Mac (version 13.329 or later)

Note that the custom functions feature is currently in preview and subject to change. It is not currently supported for use in production environments.

## Excel Online
To use custom functions within Excel Online, login by using either your Office 365 subscription or a [Microsoft account](https://account.microsoft.com/account). 

## Excel for Windows and Excel for Mac
To use custom functions within Excel for Windows or Excel for Mac, you must have an Office 365 subscription, join the [Office Insider](https://products.office.com/office-insider) program (**Insider** level -- formerly called "Insider Fast"), and use a sufficiently recent build of Excel (as specified previously).

If you are using a version of Office on your desktop which you downloaded from the Windows Store, you must be part of the [Windows Insider](https://insider.windows.com/) program at the **Insider** level (formerly called "Insider Fast"), running the April 2018 Update version or later to use custom functions. This is a new change as of January 2019.

You will also need an **Office 365 Professional Plus** subscription. Custom Functions will not load on the Home and Student versions.

## Subscribe to Office 365 Professional Plus
If you don't already have an Office 365 subscription, you can get one by joining the [Office 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev-program).
