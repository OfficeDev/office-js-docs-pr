# API open specifications

The Office JavaScript API open specifications provide information about new JavaScript APIs that are being designed for Excel, Outlook, and other host applications. The open specification phase allows us to hear from the community about upcoming designs. After we've heard from the community and are ready, the APIs are moved to a public preview requirement set and can be tested. Each host's requirement set page has details about the APIs currently in preview.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Features described in the API open specifications are subject to change and may be removed from the development cycle.

## Current open specifications

Currently, we have no APIs in the public open specification phase. We will update this page with new designs as they become available.
