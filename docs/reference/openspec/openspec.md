# API open specifications

The Office JavaScript API open specifications provide information about new JavaScript APIs that are being designed for Excel, Word, and other host applications.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Features described in the API open specifications may be in various stages of development, such as early design or public preview, and are subject to change. When an API feature becomes generally available, the [reference documentation](/javascript/api/overview/office) will be updated.

## Open specifications

The open specification phase allows us to hear from the community about upcoming designs. Currently, we have no APIs in the public open specification phase. We will update this page with new designs as they become available.

## Preview APIs

After the open specification process, new Office JavaScript enter the preview phase. To use preview APIs, your add-in must reference the **beta** library on the CDN (https://appsforoffice.microsoft.com/lib/beta/hosted/office.js) and you may also need to join the Office Insider program to get a recent Office build.

Feedback is still welcome for preview APIs. The design is not necessarily finalized at this step and we want to ensure that when the APIs are released they are of high quality. Please report any issues you encounter or thoughts or have through GitHub. Each page has a reporting link at the end of the page.
