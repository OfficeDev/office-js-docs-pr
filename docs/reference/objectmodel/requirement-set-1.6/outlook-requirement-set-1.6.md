## What's new in 1.6?

Requirement set 1.6 includes all of the features of [requirement set 1.5](../requirement-set-1.5/outlook-requirement-set-1.5.md). It added the following features.

- Added new APIs for contextual add-ins to get the entity or RegEx match that the user selected to activate the add-in.
- Added a new API to open a new message form.
- Added the ability for the add-in to determine the account type of the user's mailbox.

### Change log

- Added [Office.context.mailbox.item.getSelectedRegExMatches](office.context.mailbox.item.md#methods): Adds a new function that returns string values in a highlighted match that match the regular expressions defined in the manifest XML file. Highlighted matches apply to contextual add-ins.
- Added [Office.context.mailbox.displayNewMessageForm](office.context.mailbox.md#methods): Adds a new function that opens a new message form.
