# Add-in commands requirement sets

Requirement sets are named groups of API members. Office Add-ins use requirement sets specified in the manifest or use a runtime check to determine whether an Office application supports APIs that an add-in needs. For more information, see [Office versions and requirement sets](../../develop/office-versions-and-requirement-sets.md).

Add-in commands are UI elements that extend the Office UI and start actions in your add-in. You can use add-in commands to add a button on the ribbon or an item to a context menu. For more information, see [Add-in commands for Excel, Word, and PowerPoint](../../design/add-in-commands.md) and [Add-in commands for Outlook](../../outlook/add-in-commands-for-outlook.md).

The initial release of add-in commands doesn't have a corresponding requirement set (that is, there isn't an AddinCommands 1.0 requirement set). The following table lists the Office client applications that support the initial release version, and the build versions or number for those applications.  

| Release   |  Office 2013 on Windows<br>(one-time purchase) | Office 2016 on Windows<br>(one-time purchase) | Office 2019 on Windows<br>(one-time purchase) | Office on Windows<br>(connected to a Microsoft 365 subscription)   |  Office on iPad<br>(connected to a Microsoft 365 subscription)  |  Office on Mac<br>(connected to a Microsoft 365 subscription)  | Office on the web  |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| Add-in commands (initial release, no requirement set) | N/A | 16.0.4678.1000 *Supported in Outlook only* | Version 1809 (Build 10827.20150) or later |Version 1603 (Build 6769.0000) or later | N/A | 15.33 or later| January 2016 |

The add-in commands 1.1 requirement set introduces the ability to [autoopen a task pane with documents](../../develop/automatically-open-a-task-pane-with-a-document.md).

The following table lists the add-in commands 1.1 requirement set, the Office client applications that support that requirement set, and the build or version numbers for the Office application.

|  Requirement set  |  Office 2013 on Windows<br>(one-time purchase) | Office 2016 on Windows<br>(one-time purchase) | Office 2019 on Windows<br>(one-time purchase) | Office on Windows<br>(connected to a Microsoft 365 subscription)   |  Office on iPad<br>(connected to a Microsoft 365 subscription)  |  Office on Mac<br>(connected to a Microsoft 365 subscription)  | Office on the web  |  
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| AddinCommands 1.1  | N/A | 16.0.4678.1000 *Supported in Outlook only*  | Version 1809 (Build 10827.20150) or later | Version 1705 (Build 8121.1000) or later | N/A | 15.34 or later\*| May 2017 |

>\* The [Office.context.requirements.isSetSupported](/javascript/api/office/office.requirementsetsupport#issetsupported-name--minversion-) method will erroneously return `false` for versions 16.9 &ndash; 16.14 (inclusive), but the requirement set *is* supported on these versions.
