# Identity API requirement sets

Requirement sets are named groups of API members. Office Add-ins use requirement sets specified in the manifest or use a runtime check to determine whether an Office application supports APIs that an add-in needs. For more information, see [Office versions and requirement sets](../../develop/office-versions-and-requirement-sets.md).

Office Add-ins run across multiple versions of Office. The following table lists the Identity API requirement sets, the Office client applications that support that requirement set, and the build or version numbers for the Office application.

|  Requirement set  | Office 2013 or later on Windows<br>(one-time purchase) | Office on Windows<br>(connected to a Microsoft 365 subscription) |  Office on iPad<br>(connected to a Microsoft 365 subscription)  |  Office on Mac<br>(connected to a Microsoft 365 subscription)  | Office on the web  |
|:-----|-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| IdentityAPI 1.3  | N/A | 2008 (build 13127.20000) or later | Coming soon | 16.40 or later | August, 2020* |

> \* Initially, the requirement set is supported in Office on the web only for documents that are opened from SharePoint Online and OneDrive.com. Support for other documents will come to Office on the web later in 2020.
