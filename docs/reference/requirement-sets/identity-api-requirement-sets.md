# Identity API requirement sets

Requirement sets are named groups of API members. Office Add-ins use requirement sets specified in the manifest or use a runtime check to determine whether an Office host supports APIs that an add-in needs. For more information, see [Office versions and requirement sets](/office/dev/add-ins/develop/office-versions-and-requirement-sets).

Office Add-ins run across multiple versions of Office. The following table lists the Identity API requirement sets, the Office host applications that support that requirement set, and the build or version numbers for the Office application.

|  Requirement set  | Office 2013 or later for Windows | Office 365 for Windows   |  Office 365 for iPad  |  Office 365 for Mac  | Office Online  | SharePoint Online | OneDrive.com |Outlook.com & Exchange Online|
|:-----|-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| IdentityAPI 1.1  | N/A* | Preview* | Coming soon | Preview* | Preview | Preview| Coming soon | Coming soon |

> * During the preview phase, the Identity API requires Office 365 (the subscription version of Office). You should use the latest monthly version and build from the Insiders channel. You need to be an Office Insider to get this version. For more information, see [Be an Office Insider](https://products.office.com/office-insider?tab=tab-1). Please note that when a build graduates to the production semi-annual channel, support for preview features, including SSO, is turned off for that build.
