# Word JavaScript API requirement sets

Requirement sets are named groups of API members. Office Add-ins use requirement sets specified in the manifest or use a runtime check to determine whether an Office application supports APIs that an add-in needs. For more information, see [Office versions and requirement sets](../../develop/office-versions-and-requirement-sets.md).

## Requirement set availability

Word add-ins run across multiple versions of Office, including Office 2016 or later on Windows, and Office on the web, iPad, and Mac. The following table lists the Word requirement sets, the Office client applications that support that requirement set, and the build or version numbers for those applications.

> [!NOTE]
> To use APIs in any of the numbered requirement sets, you should reference the **production** library on the CDN: https://appsforoffice.microsoft.com/lib/1/hosted/office.js.
>
> For information about using preview APIs, see the [Excel JavaScript preview APIs](word-preview-apis.md) article.
