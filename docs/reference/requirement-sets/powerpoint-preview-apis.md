# PowerPoint JavaScript preview APIs

New PowerPoint JavaScript APIs are first introduced in "preview" and later become part of a specific, numbered requirement set after sufficient testing occurs and user feedback is acquired.

[!INCLUDE [Information about using preview APIs](../../includes/using-preview-apis-host.md)]

There are currently no APIs in preview.
