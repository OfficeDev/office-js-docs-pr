# Shared runtime requirement sets

Requirement sets are named groups of API members. Office Add-ins use requirement sets specified in the manifest or use a runtime check to determine whether an Office host supports APIs that an add-in needs. For more information, see [Office versions and requirement sets](/office/dev/add-ins/develop/office-versions-and-requirement-sets).

Parts of an Office Add-in that run JavaScript code, such as task panes, function files launched from add-in commands, and Excel custom functions, can share a single JavaScript runtime. This enables all the parts to share a set of global variables, to share a set of loaded libraries, and to communicate with each other without having to pass messages through a persisted storage.

The following table lists the SharedRuntime 1.1 requirement set, the Office host applications that support that requirement set, and the build or version numbers for the Office application.

|  Requirement set  |  Office 2013 (or later) on Windows<br>(one-time purchase) | Office on Windows<br>(connected to Office 365 subscription)   |  Office on iPad<br>(connected to Office 365 subscription)  |  Office on Mac<br>(connected to Office 365 subscription)  | Office on the web  | Office Online Server |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| SharedRuntime 1.1  | N/A | Version 2002 (Build 12527.20092) or later | N/A | 16.35 or later | February 2020 | N/A |
