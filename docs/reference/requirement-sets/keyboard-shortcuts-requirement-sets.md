# Keyboard Shortcuts requirement sets

Requirement sets are named groups of API members. Office Add-ins use requirement sets specified in the manifest or use a runtime check to determine whether an Office application supports APIs that an add-in needs. For more information, see [Office versions and requirement sets](../../develop/office-versions-and-requirement-sets.md).

Office Add-ins run across multiple versions of Office. The following table lists the Keyboard Shortcuts requirement sets, the Office client applications that support that requirement set, and the build or version numbers for the Office application.
