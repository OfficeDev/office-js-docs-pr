# Excel JavaScript API requirement sets

Requirement sets are named groups of API members. Office Add-ins use requirement sets specified in the manifest or use a runtime check to determine whether an Office host supports APIs that an add-in needs. For more information, see [Office versions and requirement sets](/office/dev/add-ins/develop/office-versions-and-requirement-sets).

## Requirement set availability

Excel add-ins run across multiple versions of Office, including Office 2016 or later on Windows, and Office on the web, Mac, and iPad. The following table lists the Excel requirement sets, the Office host applications that support each requirement set, and the build versions or number for those applications.

> [!NOTE]
> To use APIs in any of the numbered requirement sets or `ExcelApiOnline`, you should reference the **production** library on the CDN: https://appsforoffice.microsoft.com/lib/1/hosted/office.js.
>
> For information about using preview APIs, see the [Excel JavaScript preview APIs](./excel-preview-apis.md) article.
