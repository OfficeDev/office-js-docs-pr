# Excel JavaScript API requirement sets

Requirement sets are named groups of API members. Office Add-ins use requirement sets specified in the manifest or use a runtime check to determine whether an Office application supports APIs that an add-in needs. For more information, see [Office versions and requirement sets](../../develop/office-versions-and-requirement-sets.md).

## Requirement set availability

Excel add-ins run across multiple versions of Office, including Office 2016 or later on Windows, and Office on the web, Mac, and iPad. The following table lists the Excel requirement sets, the Office client applications that support each requirement set, and the build versions or number for those applications.

> [!NOTE]
> To use APIs in any of the numbered requirement sets or `ExcelApiOnline`, you should reference the **production** library on the CDN: https://appsforoffice.microsoft.com/lib/1/hosted/office.js.
>
> For information about using preview APIs, see the [Excel JavaScript preview APIs](excel-preview-apis.md) article.

## How to use Excel requirement sets at runtime and in the manifest

> [!NOTE]
> This section assumes you're familiar with the overview of requirement sets at [Office versions and requirement sets](../../develop/office-versions-and-requirement-sets.md) and [Specify Office applications and API requirements](../../develop/specify-office-hosts-and-api-requirements.md).

Requirement sets are named groups of API members. An Office Add-in can perform a runtime check or use requirement sets specified in the manifest to determine whether an Office application supports the APIs that the add-in needs.

### Checking for requirement set support at runtime

The following code sample shows how to determine whether the Office application where the add-in is running supports the specified API requirement set.

```js
if (Office.context.requirements.isSetSupported('ExcelApi', '1.3')) {
  // Perform actions.
}
else {
  // Provide alternate flow/logic.
}
```

### Defining requirement set support in the manifest

You can use the [Requirements element](../manifest/requirements.md) in the add-in manifest to specify the minimal requirement sets and/or API methods that your add-in requires to activate. If the Office application or platform doesn't support the requirement sets or API methods that are specified in the `Requirements` element of the manifest, the add-in won't run in that application or platform, and it won't display in the list of add-ins that are shown in **My Add-ins**. If your add-in requires a specific requirement set for full functionality, but it can provide value even to users on platforms that do not support the requirement set, we recommend that you check for requirement support at runtime as described above, instead of defining requirement set support in the manifest.

The following code sample shows the `Requirements` element in an add-in manifest which specifies that the add-in should load in all Office client applications that support ExcelApi requirement set version 1.3 or greater.

```xml
<Requirements>
   <Sets DefaultMinVersion="1.3">
      <Set Name="ExcelApi" MinVersion="1.3"/>
   </Sets>
</Requirements>
```
