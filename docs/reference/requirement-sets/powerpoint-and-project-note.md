# PowerPoint and Project in the JavaScript API

> [!NOTE]
> TO DO: Kim will be updating the structure and content of this article before the new TOC structure and landing pages are published to the live doc set.

PowerPoint and Project support add-ins made with the JavaScript API. However, they currently do not have host-specific APIs. You interact with these hosts through the Common API.
