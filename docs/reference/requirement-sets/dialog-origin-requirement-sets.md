# Dialog Origin requirement sets

Requirement sets are named groups of API members. Office Add-ins use requirement sets specified in the manifest or use a runtime check to determine whether an Office application supports APIs that an add-in needs. For more information, see [Office versions and requirement sets](../../develop/office-versions-and-requirement-sets.md).

Office Add-ins run across multiple versions of Office. The following table lists the Dialog Origin requirement sets, the Office client applications that support that requirement set, and the build or version numbers for the Office application.

|  Requirement set  | Office 2013 on Windows<br>(one-time purchase) | Office 2016 on Windows<br>(one-time purchase) | Office 2019 or later on Windows<br>(one-time purchase) | Office on Windows<br>(subscription) |  Office on iPad<br>(subscription)  |  Office on Mac<br>(subscription)  | Office on the web  |  Office Online Server  |
