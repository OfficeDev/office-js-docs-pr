# VersionOverrides 1.0 element in the manifest file for a task pane add-in

This element contains information for features that are not supported in the base manifest.

> [!NOTE]
> This article assumes that you are familiar with the [overview of the VersionOverrides element](versionoverrides.md), which contains important information about the element's attributes and variations.

**Add-in type:** Task pane

**Valid only in these VersionOverrides schemas**:

- Taskpane 1.0

For more information, see [Version overrides in the manifest](../../develop/add-in-manifests.md#version-overrides-in-the-manifest).

**Associated with these requirement sets**:

- [AddinCommands 1.1](../requirement-sets/add-in-commands-requirement-sets.md) (Required for Excel, PowerPoint, and Word.)
- Some child elements may be associated with additional requirement sets.

## Child elements

The following table applies only to version 1.0 of **VersionOverrides** elements and only to task pane add-ins.

> [!NOTE]
> In iOS, only `<WebApplicationInfo>` is supported. All other child elements of **VersionOverrides** are ignored.

|  Element |  Required  |  Description  |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|  [Description](#description)    |  No   |  Describes the add-in. |
|  [Requirements](requirements.md)  |  No   |  Specifies the minimum requirement sets that must be supported in order for the markup in the parent `VersionOverrides` to take effect. This should always be *more* restrictive than the `Requirements` element in the base portion of the manifest.|
|  [Hosts](hosts.md)                |  Yes  |  Specifies a collection of Office applications. The child Hosts element overrides the Hosts element in the parent portion of the manifest.  |
|  [Resources](resources.md)    |  Yes  | Defines a collection of resources (strings, URLs, and images) that other manifest elements reference.|
|  [EquivalentAddins](equivalentaddins.md)    |  No  | Specifies the native (COM/XLL) add-ins that are equivalent to the web add-in. The web add-in is not activated if an equivalent native add-in is installed.|
|  **VersionOverrides**    |  No  | Not currently usable in VersionOverrides 1.0 for taskpane add-ins. |
|  [WebApplicationInfo](webapplicationinfo.md)    |  No  | Specifies details about the add-in's registration with secure token issuers, such as Azure Active Directory V2.0. |

### Description

Describes the add-in. This overrides the `Description` element in any parent portion of the manifest. The text of the description is contained in a child element of the **LongString** element contained in the [Resources](resources.md) element. The `resid` attribute of the **Description** element can be no more than 32 characters and is set to the value of the `id` attribute of the `String` element that contains the text.

**Add-in type:** Task pane, Mail

**Valid only in these VersionOverrides schemas**:

- Task pane 1.0
- Mail 1.0
- Mail 1.1

For more information, see [Version overrides in the manifest](../../develop/add-in-manifests.md#version-overrides-in-the-manifest).

**Associated with these requirement sets**:

- [AddinCommands 1.1](../requirement-sets/add-in-commands-requirement-sets.md) when the parent `<VersionOverrides>` is type Taskpane 1.0.
- [Mailbox 1.3](../../reference/objectmodel/requirement-set-1.3/outlook-requirement-set-1.3.md) when the parent `<VersionOverrides>` is type Mail 1.0.
- [Mailbox 1.5](../../reference/objectmodel/requirement-set-1.5/outlook-requirement-set-1.5.md) when the parent `<VersionOverrides>` is type Mail 1.1.
