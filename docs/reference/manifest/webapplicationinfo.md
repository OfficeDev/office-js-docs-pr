# WebApplicationInfo element

Supports single sign-on (SSO) in Office Add-ins. This element contains information for the add-in as both:

- An OAuth 2.0 *resource* to which the Office client application might need permissions.
- An OAuth 2.0 *client* that might need permissions to Microsoft Graph.

> [!NOTE]
> The single sign-on API is currently supported for Word, Excel, Outlook, and PowerPoint. For more information about where the single sign-on API is currently supported, see [IdentityAPI requirement sets](../requirement-sets/identity-api-requirement-sets.md). If you are working with an Outlook add-in, be sure to enable Modern Authentication for the Microsoft 365 tenancy. To learn how to do this, see [Exchange Online: How to enable your tenant for modern authentication](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/32711.exchange-online-how-to-enable-your-tenant-for-modern-authentication.aspx).

**WebApplicationInfo** is a child element of the [VersionOverrides](versionoverrides.md) element in the manifest.
