# Runtime element

Configures your add-in to use a shared JavaScript runtime so that various components all run in the same runtime. Child of the [`<Runtimes>`](runtimes.md) element.

**Add-in type:** Task pane, Mail

[!include[Runtimes support](../../includes/runtimes-note.md)]

## Syntax

```XML
<Runtimes>
    <Runtime resid="ContosoAddin.Url" lifetime="long" />
</Runtimes>
```

## Contained in

- [Runtimes](runtimes.md)

## Child elements

|  Element |  Required  |  Description  |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| [Override](override.md) | No | **Outlook**: Specifies the URL location of the JavaScript file that Outlook Desktop requires for [LaunchEvent extension point](../../reference/manifest/extensionpoint.md#launchevent) handlers. **Important**: At present, you can only define one `<Override>` element and it must be of type `javascript`.|

## Attributes

|  Attribute  |  Required  |  Description  |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|  **resid**  |  Yes  | Specifies the URL location of the HTML page for your add-in. The `resid` can be no more than 32 characters and must match an `id` attribute of a `Url` element in the `Resources` element. |
|  **lifetime**  |  No  | The default value for `lifetime` is `short` and doesn't need to be specified. Outlook add-ins use only the `short` value. If you want to use a shared runtime in an Excel add-in, explicitly set the value to `long`. |
