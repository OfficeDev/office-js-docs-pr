# Requirements element

The meaning of this element depends on whether it's used [in the base manifest](#in-the-base-manifest)] or [as a child of a **VersionOverrides** element](#as-a-child-of-a-versionoverrides-element).

> [!TIP]
> Before using this element, be familiar with [Specify Office hosts and API requirements](../../develop/specify-office-hosts-and-api-requirements.md)

## In the base manifest

When used in the base manifest (that is, as a direct child of [OfficeApp](officeapp.md)), the **Requirements** element specifies the minimum set of Office JavaScript API requirements ([requirement sets](../../develop/office-versions-and-requirement-sets.md#specify-office-applications-and-requirement-sets) and/or methods) that your Office Add-in needs to be activated by Office. The add-in will not be activated on any combination of Office version and platform (such as Windows, Mac, web, and iOS or iPad) that doesn't support the specified methods and requirement sets.

**Add-in type:** Task pane, Mail

## As a child of a VersionOverrides element

When used as a child of [VersionOverrides](versionoverrides.md), specifies the minimum set of Office JavaScript API requirements ([requirement sets](../../develop/office-versions-and-requirement-sets.md#specify-office-applications-and-requirement-sets) and/or methods) that must be supported by the Office version and platform (such as Windows, Mac, web, and iOS or iPad) in order for the settings in the **VersionOverrides** element *that override base manifest settings* to take effect.

Consider an add-in that specifies requirement A in the base manifest and specifies requirement B inside the **VersionOverrides**. 

- If the platform and Office version don't support A, then the add-in isn't activated and Office doesn't parse the **VersionOverrides** section of the manifest. 
- If both A and B are supported, then the add-in is activated and all the markup in the **VersionOverrides** takes effect. 
- If A is supported, but B is not, then the add-in is activated and *some* of the markup in the **VersionOverrides** takes effect. Specifically, child elements of the **VersionOverrides** that don't override base manifest elements take effect. For example, a **WebApplicationInfo** element or a **EquivalentAddins** take effect. However, all child elements of the **VersionOverrides** that override a base manifest element, such as **Hosts**, don't take effect. Instead, Office uses the values of the base manifest markup that would otherwise have been overridden. 

**Add-in type:** Task pane, Mail

**Valid only in these VersionOverrides schemas**:

- Task pane 1.0
- Mail 1.0
- Mail 1.1

For more information, see [Version overrides in the manifest](../../develop/add-in-manifests.md#version-overrides-in-the-manifest).

**Associated with these requirement sets**:

- [AddinCommands 1.1](../requirement-sets/add-in-commands-requirement-sets.md) when the parent **VersionOverrides** is type Taskpane 1.0.
- [Mailbox 1.3](../../reference/objectmodel/requirement-set-1.3/outlook-requirement-set-1.3.md) when the parent **VersionOverrides** is type Mail 1.0.
- [Mailbox 1.5](../../reference/objectmodel/requirement-set-1.5/outlook-requirement-set-1.5.md) when the parent **VersionOverrides** is type Mail 1.1.

### Remarks

The **Requirements** element serves no purpose in a **VersionOverrides** if it specifies no additional requirements that aren't specified in a **Requirements** in the base manifest. If the Office version and platform don't support the requirements in the base manifest, the add-in isn't activated and the **VersionOverrides** element isn't parsed. For this reason, you should use a **Requirements** element in a **VersionOverrides** only when both of these conditions are met:

- Your add-in has extra features that are implemented with configuration in a **VersionOverrides** (such as Add-in Commands), and that require a method or requirement set that is *not* specified in a **Requirements** element in the base manifest.
- Your add-in is useful and should be activated (but without the extra features), even in a combination of platform and Office version that doesn't support the requirements needed for the extra features.

> [!TIP]
> Do not repeat **Requirement** elements from the base manifest inside a **VersionOverrides**. Doing so has no effect and is potentially misleading as to the purpose of the **Requirements** element inside a **VersionOverrides**.

> [!WARNING]
> Use great care before using a **Requirements** element in a **VersionOverrides**, because on platform and version combinations that don't support the requirement, *none* of the add-in commands will be installed, *even those that invoke functionality that doesn't need the requirement*. Consider, for example, an add-in that has two custom ribbon buttons. One of them calls Office JavaScript APIs that are available in requirement set **ExcelApi 1.4** (and later). The other calls APIs that are only available in **ExcelApi 1.9** (and later). If you put a requirement for **ExcelApi 1.9** in the **VersionOverrides**, *neither* button will appear on the ribbon. A better strategy in this scenario would be to use the technique described in [Runtime checks for method and requirement set support](../../develop/specify-office-hosts-and-api-requirements.md#runtime-checks-for-method-and-requirement-set-support). The code invoked by the second button first uses `isSetSupported` to check for support of **ExcelApi 1.9**. If it isn't supported, the code gives the user a message saying that this feature of the add-in isn't available on their version of Office. 

> [!NOTE]
> In Mail add-ins, it's possible for a **VersionOverrides** 1.1 to be nested inside a **VersionOverrides** 1.0. Office will always use the highest version **VersionOverrides** that is supported by the platform and Office version.
