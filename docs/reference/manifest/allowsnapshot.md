# AllowSnapshot element

Specifies whether a snapshot image of your content add-in is saved with the host document.

**Add-in type:** Content

## Syntax

```XML
<AllowSnapshot> [true | false]</AllowSnapshot>
```

## Contained in

[OfficeApp](officeapp.md)

## Remarks

 > [!IMPORTANT]
 > **AllowSnapshot** is `true` by default. This makes an image of the add-in visible for users that open the document in a version of the Office application that doesn't support Office Add-ins, or provides a static image of the add-in if the application can't connect to the server hosting the add-in. However, this also means that potentially sensitive information displayed in the add-in can be accessed directly from the document hosting the add-in.
