## Binding creation error conditions

When a binding is created in the API, indicate the binding type that you want to use. The following tables lists the binding types and the resulting binding behaviors that are expected.

### Behavior in Excel

The following table summarizes binding behavior in Excel.

|**Specified Binding Type**|**Actual Selection**|**Behavior**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Matrix|Range of cells (including within a table, and single cell)|A binding of type  _matrix_ is created on the selected cells. No modification in the document is expected.|
|Matrix|Text selected in the cell|A binding of type  _matrix_ is created on the whole cell. No modification in the document is expected.|
|Matrix|Multiple selection/invalid selection (For example, user selects a picture, object, or Word Art.)|The binding cannot be created.|
|Table|Range of cells (includes single cell)|The binding cannot be created.|
|Table|Range of cell within a table (includes single cell within a table, or the whole table, or text within a cell in a table)|A binding is created in the whole table.|
|Table|Half selection in a table and half selection outside the table|The binding cannot be created.|
|Table|Text selected in the cell (not in the table.)|The binding cannot be created.|
|Table|Multiple selection/invalid selection (For example, user selects a picture, object, Word Art, etc.)|The binding cannot be created.|

|**Specified Binding Type**|**Actual Selection**|**Behavior**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Matrix|Text|The binding cannot be created.|
|Matrix|Whole table|A binding of type  _matrix_ is created.Document is changed and a content control must wrap the table. |
