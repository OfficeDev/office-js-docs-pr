# OneNote JavaScript API overview

A OneNote add-in interacts with objects in OneNote on the web by using the [Office JavaScript API Library](../../develop/understanding-the-javascript-api-for-office.md), which includes two JavaScript object models:

* **OneNote JavaScript API**: These are the [application-specific APIs](../../develop/application-specific-api-model.md) for OneNote. Introduced with Office 2016, the [OneNote JavaScript API](/javascript/api/onenote) provides strongly-typed objects that you can use to access objects in OneNote on the web.

* **Common APIs**: Introduced with Office 2013, the [Common API](/javascript/api/office) can be used to access features such as UI, dialogs, and client settings that are common across multiple types of Office applications.

This section of the documentation focuses on the OneNote JavaScript API, which you'll use to develop most of the functionality in add-ins that target OneNote on the web. For information about the Common API, see [Common JavaScript API object model](../../develop/office-javascript-api-object-model.md).

## Learn programming concepts

See the following articles for information about important programming concepts related to OneNote extensibility.

* [OneNote JavaScript API programming overview](../../onenote/onenote-add-ins-programming-overview.md)
* [Work with OneNote page content](../../onenote/onenote-add-ins-page-content.md)

## Learn about API capabilities

For hands-on experience using the OneNote JavaScript API to interact with content in OneNote on the web, complete the [OneNote add-in quick start](../../quickstarts/onenote-quickstart.md).

For detailed information about the OneNote JavaScript API object model, see the [OneNote JavaScript API reference documentation](/javascript/api/onenote).
