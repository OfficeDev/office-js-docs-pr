# Excel JavaScript API overview

An Excel add-in interacts with objects in Excel by using the Office JavaScript API, which includes two JavaScript object models:

* **Excel JavaScript API**: Introduced with Office 2016, the [Excel JavaScript API](/javascript/api/excel) provides strongly-typed objects that you can use to access worksheets, ranges, tables, charts, and more. 

* **Common APIs**: Introduced with Office 2013, the [Common API](/javascript/api/office) can be used to access features such as UI, dialogs, and client settings that are common across multiple types of Office applications.

This section of the documentation focuses on the Excel JavaScript API, which you'll use to develop the majority of functionality in add-ins that target Excel on the web or Excel 2016 or later. For information about the Common API, see [Common JavaScript API object model](../../develop/office-javascript-api-object-model.md). 

## Learn programming concepts

See the following articles for information about important programming concepts:
 
- [Fundamental programming concepts with the Excel JavaScript API](../../excel/excel-add-ins-core-concepts.md)

- [Advanced programming concepts with the Excel JavaScript API](../../excel/excel-add-ins-advanced-concepts.md)

## Learn about API capabilities

Use other articles in this section of the documentation to learn about working with [events](../../excel/excel-add-ins-events.md), [charts](../../excel/excel-add-ins-charts.md), [ranges](../../excel/excel-add-ins-ranges.md), [tables](../../excel/excel-add-ins-tables.md), [worksheets](../../excel/excel-add-ins-worksheets.md), and more. Also in this section, you'll find guidance about Excel JavaScript API concepts such as [coauthoring in Excel add-ins](../../excel/co-authoring-in-excel-add-ins.md), [data validation](../../excel/excel-add-ins-data-validation.md), [error handling](../../excel/excel-add-ins-error-handling.md), and [performance optimization](../../excel/performance.md). See the table of contents for the complete list of available articles.

For hands-on experience using the Excel JavaScript API to access objects in Excel, complete the [Excel add-in tutorial](../../tutorials/excel-tutorial.md). 

For detailed information about the Excel JavaScript API object model, see the [Excel JavaScript API reference documentation](/javascript/api/excel).

## Try out code samples in Script Lab

Use [Script Lab](../../overview/explore-with-script-lab.md) to get started quickly with a collection of built-in samples that show how to complete tasks with the API. You can run the samples in Script Lab to instantly see the result in the task pane or worksheet, examine the samples to learn how the API works, and even use samples to prototype your own add-in.
