# Excel JavaScript API overview

An Excel add-in interacts with objects in Excel by using the JavaScript API for Office, which includes two JavaScript object models:

* **Excel JavaScript API**: Introduced with Office 2016, the [Excel JavaScript API](/javascript/api/excel) provides strongly-typed objects that you can use to access worksheets, ranges, tables, charts, and more. 

* **Common APIs**: Introduced with Office 2013, the [Common API](/javascript/api/office) can be used to access features such as UI, dialogs, and client settings that are common across multiple types of host applications such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.

This section of the documentation focuses on the Excel JavaScript API, which you'll use to develop the majority of functionality in add-ins that target Excel 2016 or later. For information about the Common API, see [JavaScript API for Office](../javascript-api-for-office.md). 

## Learn programming concepts

Review the following articles for information about important programming concepts:
 
- [Fundamental programming concepts with the Excel JavaScript API](../../excel/excel-add-ins-core-concepts.md)

- [Advanced programming concepts with the Excel JavaScript API](../../excel/excel-add-ins-advanced-concepts.md)

## Learn about API capabilities

Review other articles in this section of the documentation for guidance about using the Excel JavaScript API to implement various types of functionality in your add-in. For example, learn about working with [events](../../excel/excel-add-ins-events.md), [charts](../../excel/excel-add-ins-charts.md), [ranges](../../excel/excel-add-ins-ranges.md), [tables](../../excel/excel-add-ins-tables.md), [worksheets](../../excel/excel-add-ins-worksheets.md), and more. Also here in this section of the documentation, you'll find guidance about Excel JavaScript API concepts such as [coauthoring in Excel add-ins](../../excel/co-authoring-in-excel-add-ins.md), [data validation](../../excel/excel-add-ins-data-validation.md), [error handling](../../excel/excel-add-ins-error-handling.md), and [performance optimization](../../excel/performance.md). See the table of contents for the complete list of available articles.

For hands-on experience using the Excel JavaScript API to access objects in Excel, complete the [Excel add-in tutorial](../../tutorials/excel-tutorial.md). 

For detailed information about the Excel JavaScript API object model, see the [Excel JavaScript API reference documentation](/javascript/api/excel).

## Try out code samples in Script Lab

Use [Script Lab](../../overview/explore-with-script-lab.md) to get started quickly with a collection of built-in sample snippets that show how to complete certain tasks with the API. You can run the samples in Script Lab to instantly see the result in the task pane or document, examine the samples to learn how the API works, and even use sample snippets as the basis for prototyping functionality of your own add-in.
