# JavaScript API for Project

Project supports add-ins made with the JavaScript API, but there's currently no JavaScript API designed specifically for interacting with Project. You can use the [Common API](/javascript/api/office) to create Project add-ins. For information about the Common API, see [JavaScript API for Office](../javascript-api-for-office.md). 

## Learn about API capabilities

For hands-on experience using the Common API to interact with content in Project, complete the [Project add-in quick start](../../quickstarts/project-quickstart.md).
