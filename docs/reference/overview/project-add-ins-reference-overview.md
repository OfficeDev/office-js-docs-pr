# JavaScript API for Project

Project supports add-ins made with the JavaScript API, but there's currently no JavaScript API designed specifically for interacting with Project. You can use the Common API to interact with objects and data in Project. For information about the Common API, see [JavaScript API for Office](../javascript-api-for-office.md).
