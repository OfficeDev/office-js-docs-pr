# JavaScript API for PowerPoint

A PowerPoint add-in interacts with objects in PowerPoint by using the Office JavaScript API, which includes two JavaScript object models:

- **PowerPoint JavaScript API**: The [PowerPoint JavaScript API](/javascript/api/powerpoint) provides strongly-typed objects that you can use to access objects in PowerPoint. To learn about the asynchronous nature of the PowerPoint JavaScript APIs and how they work with the presentation, see [Using the application-specific API model](../../develop/application-specific-api-model.md).

- **Common APIs**: The [Common API](/javascript/api/office) can be used to access features such as UI, dialogs, and client settings that are common across multiple Office applications. To learn more about using the Common API, see [Common JavaScript API object model](../../develop/office-javascript-api-object-model.md).

## Learn programming concepts

See [PowerPoint add-ins overview](../../powerpoint/powerpoint-add-ins.md) for information about important programming concepts.

## Learn about API capabilities

For detailed information about the PowerPoint JavaScript API object model, see the [PowerPoint JavaScript API reference documentation](/javascript/api/powerpoint).

For hands-on experience interacting with content in PowerPoint, complete the [PowerPoint add-in tutorial](../../tutorials/powerpoint-tutorial-yo.md).

## Try out code samples in Script Lab

Use [Script Lab](../../overview/explore-with-script-lab.md) to get started quickly with a collection of built-in samples that show how to complete tasks with the API. You can run the samples in Script Lab to instantly see the result in the task pane or document, examine the samples to learn how the API works, and even use samples to prototype your own add-in.
