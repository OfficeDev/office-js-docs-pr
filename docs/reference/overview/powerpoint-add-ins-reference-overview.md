# JavaScript API for PowerPoint

A PowerPoint add-in interacts with objects in PowerPoint by using the Office JavaScript API, which includes two JavaScript object models:

* **PowerPoint JavaScript API**: The [PowerPoint JavaScript API](/javascript/api/powerpoint) provides strongly-typed objects that you can use to access objects in PowerPoint.

* **Common APIs**: Introduced with Office 2013, the [Common API](/javascript/api/office) can be used to access features such as UI, dialogs, and client settings that are common across multiple types of Office applications.

## Learn programming concepts

See [PowerPoint add-ins overview](../../powerpoint/powerpoint-add-ins.md) for information about important programming concepts.

## Learn about API capabilities

For hands-on experience using the Common API to interact with content in PowerPoint, complete the [PowerPoint add-in tutorial](../../tutorials/powerpoint-tutorial.md).

For detailed information about the PowerPoint JavaScript API object model, see the [PowerPoint JavaScript API reference documentation](/javascript/api/powerpoint).

## Try out code samples in Script Lab

Use [Script Lab](../../overview/explore-with-script-lab.md) to get started quickly with a collection of built-in samples that show how to complete tasks with the API. You can run the samples in Script Lab to instantly see the result in the task pane or document, examine the samples to learn how the API works, and even use samples to prototype your own add-in.
