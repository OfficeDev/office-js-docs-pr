# JavaScript API for PowerPoint

A PowerPoint add-in interacts with objects in PowerPoint by using the JavaScript API for Office, which includes two JavaScript object models:

* **PowerPoint JavaScript API**: Introduced with Office 2016, the [PowerPoint JavaScript API](/javascript/api/powerpoint) provides strongly-typed objects that you can use to access objects in PowerPoint. 

* **Common APIs**: Introduced with Office 2013, the [Common API](../javascript-api-for-office.md) can be used to access features such as UI, dialogs, and client settings that are common across multiple types of host applications such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.

## Learn programming concepts

Review [PowerPoint add-ins overview](../../powerpoint/powerpoint-add-ins.md) for information about important programming concepts.

## Learn about API capabilities

For detailed information about the PowerPoint JavaScript API object model, see the [PowerPoint JavaScript API reference documentation](/javascript/api/powerpoint). 

For hands-on experience using the Common API to interact with content in PowerPoint, complete the [PowerPoint add-in tutorial](../../tutorials/powerpoint-tutorial.md). 

## Try out code samples in Script Lab

Use [Script Lab](../../overview/explore-with-script-lab.md) to get started quickly with a collection of built-in sample snippets that show how to complete certain tasks with the API. You can run the samples in Script Lab to instantly see the result in the task pane or document, examine the samples to learn how the API works, and even use sample snippets as the basis for prototyping functionality of your own add-in.
