# Use fields in your Word add-in

A [field](https://support.microsoft.com/office/c429bbb0-8669-48a7-bd24-bab6ba6b06bb) in a Word document is a placeholder. It allows you to provide instructions for the content instead of the content itself. You can use fields to create and format a Word template. Word documents support a number of [field types](https://support.microsoft.com/office/1ad6d91a-55a7-4a8d-b535-cf7888659a51), many with associated parameters for configuring the field. However, Word on the web supports updating only the [Addin field type](#addin). For more information, see [Field codes in Word for the web](https://support.microsoft.com/office/d8f46094-13c3-4966-98c3-259748f3caf1).
