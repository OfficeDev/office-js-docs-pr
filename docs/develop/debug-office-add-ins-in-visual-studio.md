# Debug Office Add-ins in Visual Studio

This article describes how to use Visual Studio 2019 to debug an Office Add-in in the Office desktop client on Windows. If you're using another version of Visual Studio, the procedures might vary slightly.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't use Visual Studio to debug add-ins in Office on the web or Mac. For information about debugging on these platforms, see [Debug Office Add-ins in Office on the web](../testing/debug-add-ins-in-office-online.md) or [Debug Office Add-ins on a Mac](../testing/debug-office-add-ins-on-ipad-and-mac.md).

## Enable debugging for add-in commands and UI-less code

When Visual Studio debugs Office on Windows, the add-in is hosted in either a Microsoft Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge browser instance. To determine which browser is being used on your development computer, see [Browsers used by Office Add-ins](../concepts/browsers-used-by-office-web-add-ins.md).
> [!NOTE]
> The JS_Debug environment variable is no longer needed in the following procedure. For more information, see [Debugging behaviors in Office web add-ins](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/740413/office-development-inconsistent-script-debugging-b.html) on the Microsoft Developer Community support forum.

## Review the build and debug properties

Before you start debugging, review the properties of each project to confirm that Visual Studio will open the desired Office application and that other build and debug properties are set appropriately.

### Add-in project properties

Open the **Properties** window for the add-in project to review project properties:

1. In **Solution Explorer**, choose the add-in project (*not* the web application project).

2. From the menu bar, choose **View** > **Properties Window**.

The following table describes the properties of the add-in project.

|Property|Description|
|:-----|:-----|
|**Start Action**|Specifies the debug mode for your add-in. Currently only **Office Desktop Client** mode is supported for Office Add-in projects.|
|**Start Document**<br/>(Excel, PowerPoint, and Word add-ins only)|Specifies what document to open when you start the project.|
|**Web Project**|Specifies the name of the web project associated with the add-in.|
|**Email Address**<br/>(Outlook add-ins only)|Specifies the email address of the user account in Exchange Server or Exchange Online that you want to use to test your Outlook add-in.|
|**EWS Url**<br/>(Outlook add-ins only)|Exchange Web service URL (For example: `https://www.contoso.com/ews/exchange.aspx`). |
|**OWA Url**<br/>(Outlook add-ins only)|Outlook on the web URL (For example: `https://www.contoso.com/owa`).|
|**Use multi-factor auth**<br/>(Outlook add-ins only)|Boolean value that indicates whether multi-factor authentication should be used.|
|**User Name**<br/>(Outlook add-ins only)|Specifies the name of the user account in Exchange Server or Exchange Online that you want to use to test your Outlook add-in.|
|**Project File**|Specifies the name of the file containing build, configuration, and other information about the project.|
|**Project Folder**|The location of the project file.|

> [!NOTE]
> For an Outlook add-in, you may choose to specify values for one or more of the *Outlook add-in only* properties in the **Properties** window, but doing so is not required.

### Web application project properties

Open the **Properties** window for the web application project to review project properties:

1. In **Solution Explorer**, choose the web application project.

2. From the menu bar, choose **View** > **Properties Window**.

The following table describes the properties of the web application project that are most relevant to Office Add-in projects.

|Property|Description|
|:-----|:-----|
|**SSL Enabled**|Specifies whether SSL is enabled on the site. This property should be set to **True** for Office Add-in projects.|
|**SSL URL**|Specifies the secure HTTPS URL for the site. Read-only.|
|**URL**|Specifies the HTTP URL for the site. Read-only.|
|**Project File**|Specifies the name of the file containing build, configuration, and other information about the project.|
|**Project Folder**|Specifies the location of the project file. Read-only. The manifest file that Visual Studio generates at runtime is written to the `bin\Debug\OfficeAppManifests` folder in this location.|

## Use an existing document to debug the add-in

If you have a document that contains test data you want to use while debugging your Excel, PowerPoint, or Word add-in, Visual Studio can be configured to open that document when you start the project. To specify an existing document to use while debugging the add-in, complete the following steps.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, choose the add-in project (*not* the web application project).

2. From the menu bar, choose **Project** > **Add Existing Item**.

3. In the **Add Existing Item** dialog box, locate and select the document that you want to add.

4. Choose the **Add** button to add the document to your project.

5. In **Solution Explorer**, choose the add-in project (*not* the web application project).

6. From the menu bar, choose **View** > **Properties Window**.

7. In the **Properties** window, choose the **Start Document** list, and then select the document that you added to the project. The project is now configured to start the add-in in that document.

## Start the project

Start the project by choosing **Debug** > **Start Debugging** from the menu bar. Visual Studio will automatically build the solution and start Office to host your add-in.

> [!NOTE]
> When you start an Outlook add-in project, you'll be prompted for login credentials. If you're asked to sign in repeatedly or if you receive an error that you are unauthorized, then Basic Auth may be disabled for accounts on your Microsoft 365 tenant. In this case, try using a Microsoft account instead. You may also need to set the property "Use multi-factor auth" to True in the Outlook Web Add-in project properties dialog.

When Visual Studio builds the project it performs the following tasks.

1. Creates a copy of the XML manifest file and adds it to  `_ProjectName_\bin\Debug\OfficeAppManifests` directory. The Office application that hosts your add-in consumes this copy when you start Visual Studio and debug the add-in.

2. Creates a set of registry entries on your computer that enable the add-in to appear in the Office application.

3. Builds the web application project, and then deploys it to the local IIS web server (https://localhost).

4. If this is the first add-in project that you have deployed to local IIS web server, you may be prompted to install a Self-Signed Certificate to the current user's Trusted Root Certificate store. This is required for IIS Express to display the content of your add-in correctly.

> [!NOTE]
> The latest version of Office may use a newer web control to display the add-in contents when running on Windows 10. If this is the case, Visual Studio may prompt you to add a local network loopback exemption. This is required for the web control, in the Office client application, to be able to access the website deployed to the local IIS web server. You can also change this setting anytime in Visual Studio under **Tools** > **Options** > **Office Tools (Web)** > **Web Add-In Debugging**.

Next, Visual Studio does the following:

1. Modifies the [SourceLocation](../reference/manifest/sourcelocation.md) element of the XML manifest file by replacing the `~remoteAppUrl` token with the fully qualified address of the start page (for example, `https://localhost:44302/Home.html`).

2. Starts the web application project in IIS Express.

3. Opens the Office application.

Visual Studio doesn't show validation errors in the **OUTPUT** window when you build the project. Visual Studio reports errors and warnings in the **ERRORLIST** window as they occur. Visual Studio also reports validation errors by showing wavy underlines (known as squiggles) of different colors in the code and text editor. These marks notify you of problems that Visual Studio detected in your code. For more information about how to enable or disable validation, see [Options, Text Editor, JavaScript, IntelliSense](/visualstudio/ide/reference/options-text-editor-javascript-intellisense?view=vs-2019&preserve-view=true).

To review the validation rules of the XML manifest file in your project, see [Office Add-ins XML manifest](../develop/add-in-manifests.md).

## Debug the code for an Excel, PowerPoint, or Word add-in

If your add-in isn't visible within the document that's displayed in the Office application (Excel, PowerPoint, or Word) after you've [started the project](#start-the-project), manually launch the add-in in the Office application. For example, launch your task pane add-in by choosing the **Show Taskpane** button in the ribbon of the **Home** tab. After your add-in is displayed in Excel, PowerPoint, or Word, you can debug your code by doing the following:

1. In Excel, PowerPoint, or Word, choose the **Insert** tab and then choose the down-arrow located to the right of **My Add-ins**.

    ![Screenshot showing Insert ribbon in Excel on Windows with the My Add-ins arrow highlighted.](../images/excel-cf-register-add-in-1b.png)

2. In the list of available add-ins, find the **Developer Add-ins** section and select the your add-in to register it.

3. In Visual Studio, set breakpoints in your code.

4. In Excel, PowerPoint, or Word, interact with your add-in.

5. As breakpoints are hit in Visual Studio, step through the code as needed.

You can change your code and review the effects of those changes in your add-in without having to close the Office application and restart the project. After you save changes to your code, simply reload the add-in in the Office application. For example, reload a task pane add-in by choosing the top-right corner of the task pane to activate the [personality menu](../design/task-pane-add-ins.md#personality-menu) and then choose **Reload**.

## Debug the code for an Outlook add-in

After you've [started the project](#start-the-project) and Visual Studio launches Outlook to host your add-in, open an email message or appointment item.

Outlook activates the add-in for the item as long as the activation criteria are met. The add-in bar appears at the top of the Inspector window or Reading Pane, and your Outlook add-in appears as a button in the add-in bar. If your add-in has an add-in command, a button will appear in the ribbon, either in the default tab or a specified custom tab, and the add-in will not appear in the add-in bar.

To view your Outlook add-in, choose the button for your Outlook add-in. After your add-in is displayed in Outlook, you can debug your code by doing the following:

1. In Visual Studio, set breakpoints in your code.

2. In Outlook, interact with your add-in.

3. As breakpoints are hit in Visual Studio, step through the code as needed.

You can change your code and review the effects of those changes in your add-in without having to close Outlook and restart the project. After you save changes to your code, simply open the shortcut menu for the add-in (in Outlook), and then choose **Reload**.

## Next steps

After your add-in is working as desired, see [Deploy and publish your Office Add-in](../publish/publish.md) to learn about the ways you can distribute the add-in to users.
