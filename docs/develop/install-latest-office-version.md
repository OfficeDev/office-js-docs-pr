## Opt in to getting the latest builds of Office

- If you're a Microsoft 365 Apps for business customer, see [Microsoft 365 Insider â€‹for Business](/microsoft-365-apps/insider/).

  - Start an Office application.
  - Select **Check for Updates** on the Help menu.
  - In the Microsoft AutoUpdate box, check the box to join the Microsoft 365 Insider program.

## Get the latest build of Office

1. Download the [Office Deployment Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=49117).
1. Run the tool. This extracts a **setup.exe** and configuration files.
1. Create a new file named **configuration.xml** and add the following XML.

    ```xml
    <Configuration>
      <Add OfficeClientEdition="32" Branch="CurrentPreview">
        <Product ID="O365ProPlusRetail">
          <Language ID="en-us" />
        </Product>
      </Add>

      <Updates Enabled="TRUE" /> 
      <Display Level="None" AcceptEULA="TRUE" />  
     
    </Configuration>
    ```

1. Run the following command as an administrator.

    ```command&nbsp;line
    setup.exe /configure configuration.xml
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> The command might take a long time to run without indicating progress.

When the installation process finishes, you'll have the latest Office applications installed. To verify that you have the latest build, go to **File** > **Account** from any Office application. Under the About section, you'll see the version and build number, along with Current Channel (Preview). The Microsoft 365 Insider section is displayed or hidden for business customers depending on their company's settings.
