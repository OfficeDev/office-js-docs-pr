## Get the latest build of Office

1. Download the [Office Deployment Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=49117).
1. Run the tool. This extracts a **setup.exe** and configuration files.
1. Create a new file named **configuration.xml** and add the following XML.

    ```xml
    <Configuration>
      <Add OfficeClientEdition="32" Branch="CurrentPreview">
        <Product ID="O365ProPlusRetail">
          <Language ID="en-us" />
        </Product>
      </Add>

      <Updates Enabled="TRUE" /> 
      <Display Level="None" AcceptEULA="TRUE" />  
     
    </Configuration>
    ```

1. Run the following command as an administrator.
    ```command&nbsp;line
    setup.exe /configure configuration.xml
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> The command might take a long time to run without indicating progress.

When the installation process finishes, you will have the latest Office applications installed. To verify that you have the latest build, go to **File** > **Account** from any Office application. Under Office Updates, you'll see the (Office Insiders) label above the version number.
