# Run code in your Office Add-in when the document opens

[!include[Shared JavaScript runtime requirements](../includes/shared-runtime-requirements-note.md)]

You can configure your Office Add-in to load and run code as soon as the document is opened. This is useful if you need to register event handlers, pre-load data for the task pane, synchronize UI, or perform other tasks before the add-in is visible.

[!include[Shared runtime note](../includes/note-requires-shared-runtime.md)]

## Configure your add-in to load when the document opens

The following code configures your add-in to load and start running when the document is opened.

```JavaScript
Office.addin.setStartupBehavior(Office.StartupBehavior.load);
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `setStartupBehavior` method is asynchronous.

## Configure your add-in for no load behavior on document open

The following code configures your add-in not to start when the document is opened. Instead, it will start when the user engages it in some way, such as choosing a ribbon button or opening the task pane.

```JavaScript
Office.addin.setStartupBehavior(Office.StartupBehavior.none);
```

## Get the current load behavior

To determine what the current startup behavior is, run the following function, which returns an `Office.StartupBehavior` object.

```JavaScript
let behavior = await Office.addin.getStartupBehavior();
```

## How to run code when the document opens

When your add-in is configured to load on document open, it will run immediately. The `Office.initialize` event handler will be called. Place your startup code in the `Office.initialize` or `Office.onReady` event handler.

The following Excel add-in code shows how to register an event handler for change events from the active worksheet. If you configure your add-in to load on document open, this code will register the event handler when the document is opened. You can handle change events before the task pane is opened.

```JavaScript
// This is called as soon as the document opens.
// Put your startup code here.
Office.initialize = () => {
  // Add the event handler.
  Excel.run(async context => {
    let sheet = context.workbook.worksheets.getActiveWorksheet();
    sheet.onChanged.add(onChange);

    await context.sync();
    console.log("A handler has been registered for the onChanged event.");
  });
};

/**
 * Handle the changed event from the worksheet.
 *
 * @param event The event information from Excel
 */
async function onChange(event) {
  return Excel.run(function(context) {
    return context.sync().then(function() {
      console.log("Change type of event: " + event.changeType);
      console.log("Address of event: " + event.address);
      console.log("Source of event: " + event.source);
    });
  });
}
```

The following PowerPoint add-in code shows how to register an event handler for selection change events from the PowerPoint document. If you configure your add-in to load on document open, this code will register the event handler when the document is opened. You can handle change events before the task pane is opened.

```JavaScript
// This is called as soon as the document opens.
// Put your startup code here.
Office.onReady(info => {
  if (info.host === Office.HostType.PowerPoint) {
    Office.context.document.addHandlerAsync(Office.EventType.DocumentSelectionChanged, onChange);
    console.log("A handler has been registered for the onChanged event.");
  }
});

/**
 * Handle the changed event from the PowerPoint document.
 *
 * @param event The event information from PowerPoint
 */
async function onChange(event) {
  console.log("Change type of event: " + event.type);
}
```
