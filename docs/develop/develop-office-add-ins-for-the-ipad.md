# Special requirements for iPad add-ins

Planning to make your add-in available on iPad? Great choice! If your add-in uses only Office APIs that are supported on iPad, customers can install it on their devices. However, if you're publishing to [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com), there are some additional requirements you'll need to meet.

For details on API compatibility, see [Specify Office applications and API requirements](../develop/specify-office-hosts-and-api-requirements.md).

## iPad AppSource requirements

Here's what you need to know when submitting your add-in to AppSource for iPad users.

|Task|Description|Resources|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Apply iOS design best practices.|Make your add-in UI feel native to iOS by following Apple's design guidelines.|[Designing for iOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/designing-for-ios)|
|Make your add-in free.|Your add-in must be free on iPad. Office on iPad is a great way to reach new users who might become customers on other platforms.|[Certification policy 1120.2](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#11202-mobile-requirements)|
|Remove commerce features on iPad.|When running on iPad, your add-in can't include in-app purchases, trial offers, upselling UI, or links to online stores. Your Privacy Policy and Terms of Use pages must also be commerce-free. You can still have commerce on other platforms. Check the [Office.context.commerceAllowed](/javascript/api/office/office.context#office-office-context-commerceallowed-member) property and hide commerce features when it returns `false`.|[Certification policy 1100.3](/legal/marketplace/certification-policies#11003-selling-additional-features)|
|Submit to AppSource correctly.|In Partner Center, go to the **Product setup** page and select **Make my product available on iOS and Android (if applicable)**. You'll also need to provide your Apple developer ID in Account settings. Don't forget to review the [Application Provider Agreement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=715691).|[Make your solutions available in AppSource and within Office](/partner-center/marketplace-offers/submit-to-appsource-via-partner-center)|

## Detecting iPad devices

Want to provide a different experience for iPad users? Your add-in can detect what device it's running on and adjust accordingly. Here's how to detect iPad devices.

```javascript
const isTouchEnabled = Office.context.touchEnabled;
const allowCommerce = Office.context.commerceAllowed;

// On iPad, touchEnabled returns true and commerceAllowed returns false.
if (isTouchEnabled && !allowCommerce) {
    // Likely running on iPad - implement the iPad-specific UI.
    enableIPadInterface();
    hideCommerceFeatures();
}
```

## iPad development best practices

Ready to start building for iPad? Here are the key practices that'll help you succeed.

### Develop and debug on Windows or Mac, then test on iPad

You can't develop directly on an iPad. Develop and debug your add-in on a Windows or Mac computer, then sideload it to an iPad for testing. Since Office add-ins use the same APIs across platforms (Windows, Mac, and iOS), your code should work consistently everywhere.

For step-by-step guidance, see:

- [Test and debug Office Add-ins](../testing/test-debug-office-add-ins.md)
- [Sideload Office Add-ins on iPad for testing](../testing/sideload-an-office-add-in-on-ipad.md)

### Handle API compatibility with manifest requirements or runtime checks

You have two ways to ensure your add-in works properly across different Office versions.

**Option 1: Specify requirements in your manifest.**
When you declare API requirements in your add-in's manifest, Office automatically checks if the client app supports those APIs. If they're available, your add-in will be available too.

**Option 2: Use runtime checks.**
Alternatively, you can check if specific methods are available before using them in your code. This approach ensures your add-in is always available and provides additional functionality when supported APIs are present.

For detailed guidance on both approaches, see [Specify Office applications and API requirements](../develop/specify-office-hosts-and-api-requirements.md).

## Outlook add-ins on iPad

For information about designing Outlook add-ins that look good and work well in Outlook on mobile devices, see [Add-ins for Outlook on mobile devices](../outlook/outlook-mobile-addins.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using [Fluent UI React](../quickstarts/fluent-react-quickstart.md) for your design elements, many of these elements are built into the design system.
