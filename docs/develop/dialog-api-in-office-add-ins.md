# Use the Office dialog API in Office Add-ins

You can use the [Office dialog API](/javascript/api/office/office.ui) to open dialog boxes in your Office Add-in. This article provides guidance for using the dialog API in your Office Add-in.

> [!NOTE]
> For information about where the Dialog API is currently supported, see [Dialog API requirement sets](../reference/requirement-sets/dialog-api-requirement-sets.md). The Dialog API is currently supported for Excel, PowerPoint, and Word. Outlook support is included across various Mailbox requirement sets&mdash;see the API reference for more details.

A primary scenario for the Dialog API is to enable authentication with a resource such as Google, Facebook, or Microsoft Graph. For more information, see [Authenticate with the Office dialog API](auth-with-office-dialog-api.md) *after* you are familiar with this article.

Consider opening a dialog box from a task pane or content add-in or [add-in command](../design/add-in-commands.md) to do the following:

- Display sign-in pages that can't be opened directly in a task pane.
- Provide more screen space, or even a full screen, for some tasks in your add-in.
- Host a video that would be too small if confined to a task pane.

> [!NOTE]
> Because overlapping UI elements are discouraged, avoid opening a dialog box from a task pane unless your scenario requires it. When you consider how to use the surface area of a task pane, note that task panes can be tabbed. For an example of a tabbed task pane, see the [Excel Add-in JavaScript SalesTracker](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Excel-Add-in-JavaScript-SalesTracker) sample.

The following image shows an example of a dialog box.

![Screenshot showing dialog with 3 sign-in options displayed in front of Word.](../images/auth-o-dialog-open.png)

Note that the dialog box always opens in the center of the screen. The user can move and resize it. The window is *nonmodal*--a user can continue to interact with both the document in the Office application and with the page in the task pane, if there is one.

## Open a dialog box from a host page

The Office JavaScript APIs include a [Dialog](/javascript/api/office/office.dialog) object and two functions in the [Office.context.ui namespace](/javascript/api/office/office.ui).

To open a dialog box, your code, typically a page in a task pane, calls the [displayDialogAsync](/javascript/api/office/office.ui) method and passes to it the URL of the resource that you want to open. The page on which this method is called is known as the "host page". For example, if you call this method in script on index.html in a task pane, then index.html is the host page of the dialog box that the method opens.

The resource that is opened in the dialog box is usually a page, but it can be a controller method in an MVC application, a route, a web service method, or any other resource. In this article, 'page' or 'website' refers to the resource in the dialog box. The following code is a simple example.

```js
Office.context.ui.displayDialogAsync('https://myAddinDomain/myDialog.html');
```

> [!NOTE]
> - The URL uses the HTTP**S** protocol. This is mandatory for all pages loaded in a dialog box, not just the first page loaded.
> - The dialog box's domain is the same as the domain of the host page, which can be the page in a task pane or the [function file](../reference/manifest/functionfile.md) of an add-in command. This is required: the page, controller method, or other resource that is passed to the `displayDialogAsync` method must be in the same domain as the host page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The host page and the resource that opens in the dialog box must have the same full domain. If you attempt to pass `displayDialogAsync` a subdomain of the add-in's domain, it will not work. The full domain, including any subdomain, must match.

After the first page (or other resource) is loaded, a user can use links or other UI to navigate to any website (or other resource) that uses HTTPS. You can also design the first page to immediately redirect to another site.

By default, the dialog box will occupy 80% of the height and width of the device screen, but you can set different percentages by passing a configuration object to the method, as shown in the following example.

```js
Office.context.ui.displayDialogAsync('https://myDomain/myDialog.html', {height: 30, width: 20});
```

For a sample add-in that does this, see [Office Add-in Dialog API Example](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-Dialog-API-Simple-Example). For more samples that use `displayDialogAsync`, see [Samples](#samples).

Set both values to 100% to get what is effectively a full screen experience. (The effective maximum is 99.5%, and the window is still moveable and resizable.)

> [!NOTE]
> You can open only one dialog box from a host window. An attempt to open another dialog box generates an error. For example, if a user opens a dialog box from a task pane, she can't open a second dialog box from a different page in the task pane. However, when a dialog box is opened from an [add-in command](../design/add-in-commands.md), the command opens a new (but unseen) HTML file each time it is selected. This creates a new (unseen) host window, so each such window can launch its own dialog box. For more information, see [Errors from displayDialogAsync](dialog-handle-errors-events.md#errors-from-displaydialogasync).

### Take advantage of a performance option in Office on the web

The `displayInIframe` property is an additional property in the configuration object that you can pass to `displayDialogAsync`. When this property is set to `true`, and the add-in is running in a document opened in Office on the web, the dialog box will open as a floating iframe rather than an independent window, which makes it open faster. The following is an example.

```js
Office.context.ui.displayDialogAsync('https://myDomain/myDialog.html', {height: 30, width: 20, displayInIframe: true});
```

The default value is `false`, which is the same as omitting the property entirely. If the add-in isn't running in Office on the web, the `displayInIframe` is ignored.

> [!NOTE]
> You should **not** use `displayInIframe: true` if the dialog box will at any point redirect to a page that can't be opened in an iframe. For example, the sign in pages of many popular web services, such as Google and Microsoft account, can't be opened in an iframe.

## Send information from the dialog box to the host page

> [!NOTE]
>
> - For clarity, in this section we call the message target the host *page*, but strictly speaking the messages are going to the *JavaScript runtime* in the task pane (or the runtime that is hosting a [function file](../reference/manifest/functionfile.md)). The distinction is only significant in the case of cross-domain messaging. For more information, see [Cross-domain messaging to the host runtime](#cross-domain-messaging-to-the-host-runtime).
> - The dialog box can't communicate with the host page in the task pane unless the Office JavaScript API library is loaded in the page. (Like any page that uses the Office JavaScript API library, script for the page must initialize the add-in. For details, see [Initialize your Office Add-in](initialize-add-in.md).)

Code in the dialog box uses the [messageParent](/javascript/api/office/office.ui#messageParent_message__messageOptions_) function to send a string message to the host page. The string can be a word, sentence, XML blob, stringified JSON, or anything else that can be serialized to a string or cast to a string. The following is an example.

```js
if (loginSuccess) {
    Office.context.ui.messageParent(true.toString());
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - The `messageParent` function is one of *only* two Office JS APIs that can be called in the dialog box.
> - The other JS API that can be called in the dialog box is `Office.context.requirements.isSetSupported`. For information about it, see [Specify Office applications and API requirements](specify-office-hosts-and-api-requirements.md). However, in the dialog box, this API isn't supported in Outlook 2016 one-time purchase (that is, the MSI version).

In the next example, `googleProfile` is a stringified version of the user's Google profile.

```js
if (loginSuccess) {
    Office.context.ui.messageParent(googleProfile);
}
```

The host page must be configured to receive the message. You do this by adding a callback parameter to the original call of `displayDialogAsync`. The callback assigns a handler to the `DialogMessageReceived` event. The following is an example.

```js
var dialog;
Office.context.ui.displayDialogAsync('https://myDomain/myDialog.html', {height: 30, width: 20},
    function (asyncResult) {
        dialog = asyncResult.value;
        dialog.addEventHandler(Office.EventType.DialogMessageReceived, processMessage);
    }
);
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Office passes an [AsyncResult](/javascript/api/office/office.asyncresult) object to the callback. It represents the result of the attempt to open the dialog box. It does not represent the outcome of any events in the dialog box. For more on this distinction, see [Handle errors and events](dialog-handle-errors-events.md).
> - The `value` property of the `asyncResult` is set to a [Dialog](/javascript/api/office/office.dialog) object, which exists in the host page, not in the dialog box's execution context.
> - The `processMessage` is the function that handles the event. You can give it any name you want.
> - The `dialog` variable is declared at a wider scope than the callback because it is also referenced in `processMessage`.

The following is a simple example of a handler for the `DialogMessageReceived` event.

```js
function processMessage(arg) {
    var messageFromDialog = JSON.parse(arg.message);
    showUserName(messageFromDialog.name);
}
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Office passes the `arg` object to the handler. Its `message` property is the string sent by the call of `messageParent` in the dialog box. In this example, it is a stringified representation of a user's profile from a service such as Microsoft account or Google, so it is deserialized back to an object with `JSON.parse`.
> - The `showUserName` implementation isn't shown. It might display a personalized welcome message on the task pane.

When the user interaction with the dialog box is completed, your message handler should close the dialog box, as shown in this example.

```js
function processMessage(arg) {
    dialog.close();
    // message processing code goes here;
}
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The `dialog` object must be the same one that is returned by the call of `displayDialogAsync`.
> - The call of `dialog.close` tells Office to immediately close the dialog box.

For a sample add-in that uses these techniques, see [Office Add-in Dialog API Example](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-Dialog-API-Simple-Example).

If the add-in needs to open a different page of the task pane after receiving the message, you can use the `window.location.replace` method (or `window.location.href`) as the last line of the handler. The following is an example.

```js
function processMessage(arg) {
    // message processing code goes here;
    window.location.replace("/newPage.html");
    // Alternatively ...
    // window.location.href = "/newPage.html";
}
```

For an example of an add-in that does this, see the [Insert Excel charts using Microsoft Graph in a PowerPoint add-in](https://github.com/OfficeDev/PowerPoint-Add-in-Microsoft-Graph-ASPNET-InsertChart) sample.

### Conditional messaging

Because you can send multiple `messageParent` calls from the dialog box, but you have only one handler in the host page for the `DialogMessageReceived` event, the handler must use conditional logic to distinguish different messages. For example, if the dialog box prompts a user to sign in to an identity provider such as Microsoft account or Google, it sends the user's profile as a message. If authentication fails, the dialog box sends error information to the host page, as in the following example.

```js
if (loginSuccess) {
    var userProfile = getProfile();
    var messageObject = {messageType: "signinSuccess", profile: userProfile};
    var jsonMessage = JSON.stringify(messageObject);
    Office.context.ui.messageParent(jsonMessage);
} else {
    var errorDetails = getError();
    var messageObject = {messageType: "signinFailure", error: errorDetails};
    var jsonMessage = JSON.stringify(messageObject);
    Office.context.ui.messageParent(jsonMessage);
}
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The `loginSuccess` variable would be initialized by reading the HTTP response from the identity provider.
> - The the implementation of the `getProfile` and `getError` functions are not not shown. They each get data from a query parameter or from the body of the HTTP response.
> - Anonymous objects of different types are sent depending on whether the sign in was successful. Both have a `messageType` property, but one has a `profile` property and the other has an `error` property.

The handler code in the host page uses the value of the `messageType` property to branch as shown in the following example. Note that the `showUserName` function is the same as in the previous example and `showNotification` function displays the error in the host page's UI.

```js
function processMessage(arg) {
    var messageFromDialog = JSON.parse(arg.message);
    if (messageFromDialog.messageType === "signinSuccess") {
        dialog.close();
        showUserName(messageFromDialog.profile.name);
        window.location.replace("/newPage.html");
    } else {
        dialog.close();
        showNotification("Unable to authenticate user: " + messageFromDialog.error);
    }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `showNotification` implementation isn't shown in the sample code provided by this article. For an example of how you might implement this function within your add-in, see [Office Add-in Dialog API Example](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-Dialog-API-Simple-Example).

### Cross-domain messaging to the host runtime

Either the dialog or the parent JavaScript runtime (either in a task pane or a UI-less runtime that hosts a function file) may be navigated away from the add-in's domain after the dialog is opened. If either of these things has happened, then a call of `messageParent` will fail unless your code specifies the domain of the parent runtime. You do this by adding a [DialogMessageOptions](/javascript/api/office/office.dialogmessageoptions) parameter to the call of `messageParent`. This object has a `targetOrigin` property that specifies the domain to which the message should be sent. If the parameter isn't used, Office assumes that the target is the same domain that the dialog is currently hosting.

> [!NOTE]
> Using `messageParent` to send a cross-domain message requires the [Dialog Origin 1.1 requirement set](../reference/requirement-sets/dialog-origin-requirement-sets.md). The `DialogMessageOptions` parameter is ignored on older versions of Office that do not support the requirement set, so the behavior of the method is unaffected if you pass it.

The following is an example of using `messageParent` to send a cross-domain message.

```js
Office.context.ui.messageParent("Some message", { targetOrigin: "https://resource.contoso.com" });
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `DialogMessageOptions` parameter was released approximately July 19th, 2021. For about 30 days after that date, in Office on the web, the first time that `messageParent` is called without the `DialogMessageOptions` parameter and the parent is a different domain from the dialog, the user will be prompted to approve sending data to the target domain. If the user approves, the user's answer is cached for 24 hours. The user isn't prompted again during this period when `messageParent` is called with the same target domain.

If the message doesn't include sensitive data, you can set the `targetOrigin` to "\*" which allows it to be sent to any domain. The following is an example.

```js
Office.context.ui.messageParent("Some message", { targetOrigin: "*" });
```

> [!TIP]
> The `DialogMessageOptions` parameter was added to the `messageParent` method as a required parameter in mid-2021. Older add-ins that send a cross-domain message with the method no longer work until they are updated to use the new parameter. Until the add-in is updated, *on Office for Windows only*, users and system administrators can enable those add-ins to continue working by specifying the trusted domain(s) with a registry setting: **HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\16.0\WEF\AllowedDialogCommunicationDomains**. To do this, create a file with a `.reg` extension, save it to the Windows computer, and then double-click it to run it. The following is an example of the contents of such a file.
>
> ```
> Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
> 
> [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\16.0\WEF\AllowedDialogCommunicationDomains]
> "My trusted domain"="https://www.contoso.com"
> "Another trusted domain"="https://fabrikam.com"
> ```

## Pass information to the dialog box

Your add-in can send messages from the [host page](dialog-api-in-office-add-ins.md#open-a-dialog-box-from-a-host-page) to a dialog box using [Dialog.messageChild](/javascript/api/office/office.dialog#messageChild_message__messageOptions_).

### Use `messageChild()` from the host page

When you call the Office dialog API to open a dialog box, a [Dialog](/javascript/api/office/office.dialog) object is returned. It should be assigned to a variable that has greater scope than the [displayDialogAsync](/javascript/api/office/office.ui#displayDialogAsync_startAddress__callback_)
method because the object will be referenced by other methods. The following is an example.

```javascript
var dialog;
Office.context.ui.displayDialogAsync('https://myDomain/myDialog.html',
    function (asyncResult) {
        dialog = asyncResult.value;
        dialog.addEventHandler(Office.EventType.DialogMessageReceived, processMessage);
    }
);

function processMessage(arg) {
    dialog.close();

  // message processing code goes here;

}
```

This `Dialog` object has a [messageChild](/javascript/api/office/office.dialog#messageChild_message__messageOptions_) method that sends any string, including stringified data, to the dialog box. This raises a `DialogParentMessageReceived` event in the dialog box. Your code should handle this event, as shown in the next section.

Consider a scenario in which the UI of the dialog is related to the currently active worksheet and that worksheet's position relative to the other worksheets. In the following example, `sheetPropertiesChanged` sends Excel worksheet properties to the dialog box. In this case, the current worksheet is named "My Sheet" and it's the second sheet in the workbook. The data is encapsulated in an object and stringified so that it can be passed to `messageChild`.

```javascript
function sheetPropertiesChanged() {
    var messageToDialog = JSON.stringify({
                               name: "My Sheet",
                               position: 2
                           });

    dialog.messageChild(messageToDialog);
}
```

### Handle DialogParentMessageReceived in the dialog box

In the dialog box's JavaScript, register a handler for the `DialogParentMessageReceived` event with the [UI.addHandlerAsync](/javascript/api/office/office.ui#addHandlerAsync_eventType__handler__options__callback_) method. This is typically done in the [Office.onReady or Office.initialize methods](initialize-add-in.md), as shown in the following. (A more robust example is below.)

```javascript
Office.onReady()
    .then(function() {
        Office.context.ui.addHandlerAsync(
            Office.EventType.DialogParentMessageReceived,
            onMessageFromParent);
    });
```

Then, define the `onMessageFromParent` handler. The following code continues the example from the preceding section. Note that Office passes an argument to the handler and that the `message` property of the argument object contains the string from the host page. In this example, the message is reconverted to an object and jQuery is used to set the top heading of the dialog to match the new worksheet name.

```javascript
function onMessageFromParent(arg) {
    var messageFromParent = JSON.parse(arg.message);
    $('h1').text(messageFromParent.name);
}
```

It is a best practice to verify that your handler is properly registered. You can do this by passing a callback to the `addHandlerAsync` method. This runs when the attempt to register the handler completes. Use the handler to log or show an error if the handler was not successfully registered. The following is an example. Note that `reportError` is a function, not defined here, that logs or displays the error.

```javascript
Office.onReady()
    .then(function() {
        Office.context.ui.addHandlerAsync(
            Office.EventType.DialogParentMessageReceived,
            onMessageFromParent,
            onRegisterMessageComplete);
    });

function onRegisterMessageComplete(asyncResult) {
    if (asyncResult.status !== Office.AsyncResultStatus.Succeeded) {
        reportError(asyncResult.error.message);
    }
}
```

### Conditional messaging from parent page to dialog box

Because you can make multiple `messageChild` calls from the host page, but you have only one handler in the dialog box for the `DialogParentMessageReceived` event, the handler must use conditional logic to distinguish different messages. You can do this in a way that is precisely parallel to how you would structure conditional messaging when the dialog box is sending a message to the host page as described in [Conditional messaging](#conditional-messaging).

> [!NOTE]
> In some situations, the `messageChild` API, which is a part of the [DialogApi 1.2 requirement set](../reference/requirement-sets/dialog-api-requirement-sets.md), may not be supported. Some alternative ways for parent-to-dialog-box messaging are described in [Alternative ways of passing messages to a dialog box from its host page](parent-to-dialog.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [DialogApi 1.2 requirement set](../reference/requirement-sets/dialog-api-requirement-sets.md) can't be specified in the `<Requirements>` section of an add-in manifest. You will have to check for support for DialogApi 1.2 at runtime using the [isSetSupported](specify-office-hosts-and-api-requirements.md#use-runtime-checks-in-your-javascript-code) method. Support for manifest requirements is under development.

### Cross-domain messaging to the dialog runtime

Either the dialog or the parent JavaScript runtime (either in a task pane or a UI-less runtime that hosts a function file) may be navigated away from the add-in's domain after the dialog is opened. If either of these things has happened, then a call of `messageChild` will fail unless your code specifies the domain of the dialog runtime. You do this by adding a [DialogMessageOptions](/javascript/api/office/office.dialogmessageoptions) parameter to the call of `messageChild`. This object has a `targetOrigin` property that specifies the domain to which the message should be sent. If the parameter isn't used, Office assumes that the target is the same domain that the parent runtime is currently hosting. 

> [!NOTE]
> Using `messageChild` to send a cross-domain message requires the [Dialog Origin 1.1 requirement set](../reference/requirement-sets/dialog-origin-requirement-sets.md). The `DialogMessageOptions` parameter is ignored on older versions of Office that do not support the requirement set, so the behavior of the method is unaffected if you pass it.

The following is an example of using `messageChild` to send a cross-domain message.

```js
dialog.messageChild(messageToDialog, { targetOrigin: "https://resource.contoso.com" });
```

If the message doesn't include sensitive data, you can set the `targetOrigin` to "\*" which allows it to be *sent* to any domain. The following is an example.

```js
dialog.messageChild(messageToDialog, { targetOrigin: "*" });
```

Because the JavaScript runtime that is hosting the dialog can't access the `<AppDomains>` section of the manifest and thereby determine whether the domain *from which the message comes* is trusted, you must use the `DialogParentMessageReceived` handler to determine this. The object that is passed to the handler contains the domain that is currently hosted in the parent  as its `origin` property. The following is an example of how to use the property.

```javascript
function onMessageFromParent(arg) {
    if (arg.origin === "https://addin.fabrikam.com") {
        // process message
    } else {
        dialog.close();
        showNotification("Messages from " + arg.origin + " are not accepted.");
    }
}
```

For example, your code could use the [Office.onReady or Office.initialize methods](initialize-add-in.md) to store an array of trusted domains in a global variable. The `arg.origin` property could then be checked against that list in the handler.

> [!TIP]
> The `DialogMessageOptions` parameter was added to the `messageChild` method as a required parameter in mid-2021. Older add-ins that send a cross-domain message with the method no longer work until they are updated to use the new parameter. Until the add-in is updated, *on Office for Windows only*, users and system administrators can enable those add-ins to continue working by specifying the trusted domain(s) with a registry setting: **HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\16.0\WEF\AllowedDialogCommunicationDomains**. To do this, create a file with a `.reg` extension, save it to the Windows computer, and then double-click it to run it. The following is an example of the contents of such a file.
>
> ```
> Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
> 
> [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\16.0\WEF\AllowedDialogCommunicationDomains]
> "My trusted domain"="https://www.contoso.com"
> "Another trusted domain"="https://fabrikam.com"
> ```

## Close the dialog box

You can implement a button in the dialog box that will close it. To do this, the click event handler for the button should use `messageParent` to tell the host page that the button has been clicked. The following is an example.

```js
function closeButtonClick() {
    var messageObject = {messageType: "dialogClosed"};
    var jsonMessage = JSON.stringify(messageObject);
    Office.context.ui.messageParent(jsonMessage);
}
```

The host page handler for `DialogMessageReceived` would call `dialog.close`, as in this example. (See previous examples that show how the `dialog` object is initialized.)

```js
function processMessage(arg) {
    var messageFromDialog = JSON.parse(arg.message);
    if (messageFromDialog.messageType === "dialogClosed") {
       dialog.close();
    }
}
```

Even when you don't have your own close-dialog UI, an end user can close the dialog box by choosing the **X** in the upper-right corner. This action triggers the `DialogEventReceived` event. If your host pane needs to know when this happens, it should declare a handler for this event. See the section [Errors and events in the dialog box](dialog-handle-errors-events.md#errors-and-events-in-the-dialog-box) for details.
