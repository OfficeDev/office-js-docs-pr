# Create a Node.js Office Add-in that uses single sign-on (preview)

Users can sign in to Office, and your Office Web Add-in can take advantage of this sign-in process to authorize users to your add-in and to Microsoft Graph without requiring users to sign in a second time. For an overview, see [Enable SSO in an Office Add-in](sso-in-office-add-ins.md).

## UNDER CONSTRUCTION

There has been a recent change in the SSO APIs. We are working on a new walkthrough that explains how to create an add-in that uses SSO and that is built with Node.js, Express, and msal.js. In the meantime, see the complete sample at [Office Add-in NodeJS SSO](https://github.com/officedev/office-add-in-nodejs-sso).
