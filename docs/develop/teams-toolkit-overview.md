# Create Office Add-in projects with Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit

A primary tool for developing Microsoft 365 apps and agents is Agents Toolkit. You can create Office Add-ins with Agents Toolkit.

Add-ins created with Agents Toolkit use the [unified manifest for Microsoft 365](unified-manifest-overview.md).

   [!INCLUDE [Unified manifest support note for Office applications](../includes/unified-manifest-support-note.md)]

> [!TIP]
> There's another Visual Studio Code extension that creates Office Add-ins that use the add-in only manifest. See [Create Office Add-in projects using Office Add-ins Development Kit for Visual Studio Code](development-kit-overview.md).

   [!INCLUDE [non-unified manifest clients note](../includes/non-unified-manifest-clients.md)]

Install the latest version of Agents Toolkit into Visual Studio Code as described in [Install Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit](/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/install-teams-toolkit?tabs=vscode).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can create an Outlook add-in with the latest released version of Agents Toolkit. To create an add-in for Excel, PowerPoint, or Word, install the prerelease version as described in [Install a prerelease version](/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/install-teams-toolkit?tabs=vscode#install-a-prerelease-version). The toolkit creates projects that use the [unified manifest for Microsoft 365](json-manifest-overview.md). Support for this manifest in Excel, PowerPoint, and Word is preview only. 

## Create an Office Add-in project

1. Open Visual Studio Code and select Agents Toolkit icon in the **Activity Bar**.

    :::image type="content" source="../images/teams-toolkit-icon.png" alt-text="Agents Toolkit icon.":::

1. Select **Create a New App**.
1. The **New Project** dropdown menu opens. The options listed will vary depending on your version of Agents Toolkit. Select **Office Add-in**.

    :::image type="content" source="../images/atk-toolkit-new-project-list.png" alt-text="The options in New Project dropdown menu. One option is called 'Office Add-in'.":::

1. The **App Features Using an Office Add-in** dropdown menu opens. The options listed will vary depending on your version of Agents Toolkit. Select **Task pane**.

    :::image type="content" source="../images/teams-toolkit-create-office-task-pane-capability.png" alt-text="The options in the App Features Using an Office Add-in dropdown menu. The option 'Task pane' is selected.":::

1. In the **Workspace Folder** dialog that opens, select the folder where you want to create the project.
1. Give a name to the project (with no spaces) when prompted. Agents Toolkit will create the project with basic files and scaffolding. It will then open the project *in a second Visual Studio Code window*. Close the original Visual Studio Code window.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The project that's generated is configured to be installable on Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, and Word. You can edit the manifest and source files as needed to change which Office applications are supported.

1. In the Visual Studio Code **TERMINAL** navigate to the root of the project and run `npm install`.
1. After the installation completes, verify that you can sideload your add-in from Visual Studio Code. The steps to sideload vary depending on the Office application on which you want to test the add-in.

### Sideload in Excel, PowerPoint, or Word

> [!NOTE]
> This section only applies if you are developing the add-in on a *Windows* computer. If you work on a Mac, you can test the add-in by having your Microsoft 365 administrator deploy the add-in as an [integrated app](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/test-and-deploy-microsoft-365-apps) in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center.

1. Select **View** | **Run** in Visual Studio Code. In the **RUN AND DEBUG** dropdown menu, select one of these options:
 
    - **Excel Desktop (Edge Chromium)**
    - **PowerPoint Desktop (Edge Chromium)**
    - **Word Desktop (Edge Chromium)**

1. Press F5. The project builds and a Node dev-server window opens. This process may take a couple of minutes. Eventually, the desktop version of the Office application you selected opens.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If this is the first time that you have sideloaded an Office Add-in on your computer (or the first time in over a month), you may be prompted to delete an old certificate and/or to install a new one. Agree to both prompts.

1. A **Contoso Add-in** tab with two buttons will appear on the **Home** ribbon. Use one button to perform an action in the open Office document. Use the other to open the add-in's task pane.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Regardless of which button you select, a **WebView Stop On Load** prompt appears. Select **OK**.

1. To stop debugging and uninstall the add-in, select **Run** | **Stop Debugging** in Visual Studio Code.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the preceding step seems to have no effect, uninstall the add-in by opening a **TERMINAL** in Visual Studio Code, and then running the command `npm run stop`. Closing the server window doesn't reliably stop the server and closing the Office application doesn't reliably cause Office to unacquire the add-in.

### Sideload in Outlook

> [!NOTE]
> If your development computer is Windows, be sure that your Outlook client is classic Outlook for Windows, not [new Outlook on Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/office/656bb8d9-5a60-49b2-a98b-ba7822bc7627). There is currently a bug that prevents add-ins created with Agents Toolkit from properly sideloading in new Outlook for Windows or in Outlook on the web.

1. Ensure that your account in your Microsoft 365 developer tenancy is also an email account in desktop Outlook. If it isn't, follow the guidance in [Add an email account to Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/office/e9da47c4-9b89-4b49-b945-a204aeea6726).
1. **Close Outlook desktop**.
1. In Visual Studio Code, open Agents Toolkit.
1. In the **ACCOUNTS** section, verify that you're signed into Microsoft 365.
1. Select **View** | **Run** in Visual Studio Code. In the **RUN AND DEBUG** dropdown menu, select the option, **Outlook Desktop (Edge Chromium)**, and then press F5. The project builds and a Node dev-server window opens. This process may take a couple of minutes and then Outlook desktop will open.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If this is the first time that you have sideloaded an Office Add-in on your computer (or the first time in over a month), you may be prompted to delete an old certificate and/or to install a new one. Agree to both prompts.

1. Open the **Inbox** *of your Microsoft 365 account identity* and open any message. A **Contoso Add-in** tab with two buttons will appear on the **Home** ribbon (or the **Message** ribbon, if you have opened the message in its own window).
1. Click the **Show Taskpane** button and a task pane opens. Click the **Perform an action** button and a small notification appears near the top of the message.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Regardless of which button you select, a **WebView Stop On Load** prompt appears. Select **OK**.

1. To stop debugging and uninstall the add-in, select **Run** | **Stop Debugging** in Visual Studio Code.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the preceding step seems to have no effect, uninstall the add-in by opening a **TERMINAL** in Visual Studio Code, and then running the command `npm run stop`. Closing the server window doesn't reliably stop the server and closing the Office application doesn't reliably cause Office to unacquire the add-in.

## Develop your project

Now you can change and develop the project. In places where the guidance in the Office Add-ins documentation branches depending on what type of manifest is being used, be sure to follow the guidance for the unified manifest.
