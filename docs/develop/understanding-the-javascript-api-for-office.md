# Understanding the JavaScript API for Office

This article provides information about the JavaScript API for Office and how to use it. For reference information, see [JavaScript API for Office](/office/dev/add-ins/reference/javascript-api-for-office). For information about updating Visual Studio project files to the most current version of the JavaScript API for Office, see [Update the version of your JavaScript API for Office and manifest schema files](update-your-javascript-api-for-office-and-manifest-schema-version.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you plan to [publish](../publish/publish.md) your add-in to AppSource and make it available within the Office experience, make sure that you conform to the [AppSource validation policies](/office/dev/store/validation-policies).Â For example, to pass validation, your add-in must work across all platforms that support the methods that you define (for more information, see [section 4.12](/office/dev/store/validation-policies#4-apps-and-add-ins-behave-predictably) and the [Office Add-in host and availability page](../overview/office-add-in-availability.md)).
