# Understanding the JavaScript API for Office

An Office Add-in can use the Office JavaScript APIs to interact with content in the Office document where the add-in is running.

## Accessing the Office JavaScript library

[!include[information about accessing the Office JS API library](../includes/office-js-access-library.md)]

## API models

[!include[information about the Office JS API models](../includes/office-js-api-models.md)]

## API requirement sets

[!include[information about the Office JS API requirement sets](../includes/office-js-requirement-sets.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> If you plan to [publish](../publish/publish.md) your add-in to AppSource and make it available within the Office experience, make sure that you conform to the [AppSource validation policies](/office/dev/store/validation-policies). For example, to pass validation, your add-in must work across all platforms that support the methods that you define (for more information, see [section 4.12](/office/dev/store/validation-policies#4-apps-and-add-ins-behave-predictably) and the [Office Add-in host and availability page](../overview/office-add-in-availability.md)).
