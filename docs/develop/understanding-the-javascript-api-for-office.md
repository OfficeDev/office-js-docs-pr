# Understanding the JavaScript API for Office

This article provides information about the JavaScript API for Office and how to use it. For reference information, see [JavaScript API for Office](/office/dev/add-ins/reference/javascript-api-for-office). For information about updating Visual Studio project files to the most current version of the JavaScript API for Office, see [Update the version of your JavaScript API for Office and manifest schema files](update-your-javascript-api-for-office-and-manifest-schema-version.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you plan to [publish](../publish/publish.md) your add-in to AppSource and make it available within the Office experience, make sure that you conform to the [AppSource validation policies](/office/dev/store/validation-policies).Â For example, to pass validation, your add-in must work across all platforms that support the methods that you define (for more information, see [section 4.12](/office/dev/store/validation-policies#4-apps-and-add-ins-behave-predictably) and the [Office Add-in host and availability page](../overview/office-add-in-availability.md)). 

## Referencing the JavaScript API for Office library in your add-in

The [JavaScript API for Office](/office/dev/add-ins/reference/javascript-api-for-office) library consists of the Office.js file and associated host application-specific .js files, such as Excel-15.js and Outlook-15.js. The simplest method of referencing the API is using our CDN by adding the following `<script>` to your page's `<head>` tag:  

```html
<script src="https://appsforoffice.microsoft.com/lib/1/hosted/office.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

This will download and cache the JavaScript API for Office files the first time your add-in loads to make sure that it is using the most up-to-date implementation of Office.js and its associated files for the specified version.

For more details around the Office.js CDN, including how versioning and backward compatibility is handled, see [Referencing the JavaScript API for Office library from its content delivery network (CDN)](referencing-the-javascript-api-for-office-library-from-its-cdn.md).
