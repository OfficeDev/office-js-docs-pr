# Use the Office Dialog to show a video

> [!NOTE]
> This article presupposes that you are familiar with the basics of using the Office Dialog as described in [Use the Dialog API in your Office Add-ins](dialog-api-in-office-add-ins.md).

To show a video in a dialog box with the Office Dialog API take these steps:

1. Create a page whose only content is an iframe. (The page must be in the same domain as the host page.) The `src` attribute of the iframe points to an online video. The protocol of the video's URL must be HTTPS. In this article we'll call this page "video.dialogbox.html". The following is an example of the markup:

    ```HTML
    <iframe class="ms-firstrun-video__player"  width="640" height="360"
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XVfOe5mFbAE?rel=0&autoplay=1"
        frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>
    ```

2. Use a call of `displayDialogAsync` in the host page to open video.dialogbox.html.
3. If your add-in needs to know when the user closes the dialog box, register a handler for the `DialogEventReceived` event and handle the 12006 event. For details, see the section [Errors and events in the dialog](dialog-handle-errors-events.md).

For a sample that shows a video in a dialog box, see the [video placemat design pattern](/office/dev/add-ins/design/first-run-experience-patterns#video-placemat).
