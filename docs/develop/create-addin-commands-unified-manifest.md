# Create add-in commands with the unified Microsoft 365 manifest

Add-in commands provide an easy way to customize the default Office user interface (UI) with specified UI elements that perform actions. For an introduction to add-in commands, see [Add-in commands](../design/add-in-commands.md).

This article describes how to edit the unified manifest to define add-in commands and how to create the code for [function commands](../design/add-in-commands.md#types-of-add-in-commands). 

> [!TIP]
> Instructions for creating add-in commands with the XML manifest are in [Create add-in commands with the XML manifest](create-addin-commands.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The unified manifest is currently supported only for Outlook Add-ins. It is in preview and should not be used for production add-ins.
